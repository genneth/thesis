\begin_layout Title
Stochastic Cell Fate Choice from Lineage Tracing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Gen Zhang

\begin_layout Chapter*
Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Advances in genetic methods for lineage tracing offers a new way to observe
 and dissect cell fate choice.
 Specifically, the ability to tag and eventually observe the fate of individual
 cells allows classification beyond instantaneous expression of RNA or protein.
 We thus build stochastic models which directly predict the fate outcomes
 of progenitor cells in different tissues, and use experimental data to
 quantify the effective parameters in these models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by quantitatively studying mouse oesophageal lining, an extremely
 simple model tissue for stratified epithelia in homoeostasis.
 After establishing that there exists only one progenitor population responsible
 for maintenance, we postulate a simple model of critical branching, and
 measure the parameters of the model from lineage tracing data.
 We use this model to understand drug action and behaviour under wounding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further develop the theory of branching processes, focusing on the behaviour
 of super-critical processes and the link between cell cycle distribution
 and asymptotic size distribution.
 We establish some novel theorems characterising legitimate asymptotic size
 distributions, and a formula to recover cell cycle distributions from such
 size distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we turn to the development of vertebrate central nervous system,
 using the retina as a proxy.
 We first look at rat retinal progenitors in vitro, establishing that a
 stochastic model of fate choice is possible.
 We then turn to zebrafish embryos, which allow live imaging throughout
 the development process.
 Although complex, we find that a simple model is nevertheless sufficient
 to explain the data, though necessarily more descriptive than quantitatively
 precise.

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is still an outstanding question of biology how cells work together to
 build large scale tissues.
 Whilst cells individually are constrained to the two simple fates of division
 or eventual death, it is poorly understood how cells might work in concert
 to synchronise and regulate their fates 
\emph on
in situ
\emph default
 to grow, maintain, or repair tissue, or further how failures of such regulation
 lead to failure or cancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally, the problem has been tackled with a reductionist approach
 of explicating the molecular mechanism within cells.
 In particular, a large body of work now exist which delineate the various
 gene and protein expression networks that modify cell fate.
 A central challenge to this effort is the vast complexity of the uncovered
 biochemical networks, which confound attempts to identify simple principles
 and concepts which interact in predictable ways to allow comprehension
 and prediction of a range of observations.
 Instead, often the clearest biochemical dissection occur very far from
 a typical environment, leading to difficulties, for example, in translating
 cell fate choice in culture to that during regular maintenance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead, the work of Klein and Simons advocated a more phenomenological
 approach, where by directly measuring and mathematically modelling quantitative
 characteristics of tissues it becomes possible to infer the relevant underlying
 dynamics of cells.
 Typically, one would focus on behaviours which arise because of the large
 number of cells and their interactions, which are robust to small changes
 of the underlying cell-resolution biochemistry.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 showed that with modern techniques such as inducible genetic labelling
 and confocal microscopy, it is indeed possible to collect such data and
 carry out the program for interfollicular epidermis (IFE) in normal maintenance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case, cells in the IFE were modelled as non-interacting, each cell
 independently choosing when to divide or permanently differentiate and
 leave the basal layer.
 The study of such systems has a long tradition in mathematical biology,
 under the title of branching processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Athreya2004"

\end_inset

.
 A crucial theorem of that theory states that: assuming a population of
 cells which maintain their number (i.e.
 homoeostatic or in equilibrium), if one were to label a single cell and
 count its progeny (a clone), then in the interesting case where some of
 that clone continue to proliferate, their number would eventually (on average)
 increase linearly with time, 
\emph on
independent of any other features of those cells
\emph default
.
 In corollary, the chance of such a surviving clone must decrease as one
 over time.
 In particular, one makes no assumption about distributions of cell cycle
 lengths, or the precise hierarchy leading from self-proliferation to differenti
ation.
 The only assumptions are independence and homoeostasis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is in fact an example of 
\emph on
universal behaviour
\emph default
, a term borrowed from statistical physics to describe phenomena which only
 occur in the presence of sufficiently large number of particles (here,
 cells), and which do not depend on microscopic details, but rather on symmetrie
s and dimensionality of the situation.
 Such robustness of prediction allows for easy confirmation in experiments,
 and indeed precisely this linear scaling was a central argument in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Clayton2007"

\end_inset

 as part of the evidence that there existed a fast-cycling, self-renewing
 population of progenitors in IFE.
 Note that it is only the linear scaling which is universal: the rate at
 which the clone can be expected to grow is not, and will depend in complex
 ways on the microscopic details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, one might wonder about the assumption of independence.
 Whilst relying on statistical averaging to achieve homoeostasis is nice
 in theory, one cannot but feel that some negative feedback loop would be
 more stable, especially in the presence of injury.
 A simple model might be that of cells which differentiate and leave behind
 a hole, which is filled by one of its neighbours --- as might be expected
 for contact inhibition of progenitors.
 Such models are known in the mathematical literature as 
\emph on
voter models
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "CLIFFORD1973"

\end_inset

.
 If one imagines labelling each cell individually, a differentiating cell
 getting replaced is the same as if that cell simply changed its label to
 that of its neighbour --- analogous to how opinions spread in a group of
 weak-willed voters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In analogy to our one-cell derived clone in the branching process, we can
 ask what happens to a single labelled cell in a sea of unlabelled cells.
 It is known 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bramson1980"

\end_inset

 that the answer depends crucially on the dimension of the space that the
 cells live in.
 Assuming that the clone survives, at large times: 
\end_layout

and in 3D (or, as a mathematical extension, above 3D), 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[n|n>0\right]\sim t$
\end_inset

, just as if there were no interactions at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, in low dimensions, a cell is likely to be replaced by a cell
 of the same label, leading to a sort of jamming where the boundary of the
 clone does not grow very fast; in higher dimensions, a cell will be replaced
 by a randomly labelled cell, and so each division will look very much random,
 and indistinguishable from a non-interacting situation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be precise, the results above have only been mathematically proven in
 square lattices, and a few others regular lattices (hexagonal, for instance).
 However, a body of numerical and theoretical work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bramson1979,Ben-Naim1996,Dornic2001,Dornic2005,Canet2005"

\end_inset

 suggest that the scaling is in fact universal, and do not depend on the
 details of the geometry, or how the interaction works exactly.
 For instance, it may be that cells are replaced not by immediate neighbours,
 but rather by any within a few cell diameters.

 It has been hypothesised 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 that in the IFE may exihibit the 2-dimensional case, but fundamentally,
 the extra factor of
\begin_inset Formula $\log\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is too close to a constant for achievable experiments to be seen: at short
 times, the jamming has not really set in and clone sizes still scale as
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and once the dynamics approaches the universal limit (which may take months),
 
\begin_inset Formula $t/\log\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 between 1 month and 12 months is not easily distinguishable from a linear
 function of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Limits of universality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst universal scaling is very useful for confirming that a particular
 choice of basic symmetries and assumptions is sufficient to describe an
 experiment, its very robustness against all manners of perturbations becomes
 a liability when one wishes to extract from experiment some quantitative
 measurements of the underlying process.
 For instance, whilst in mouse IFE it is possible to measure the non-universal
 rate constant associated with linear scaling of surviving clone sizes,
 that constant is not related to the underlying cell-scale dynamics in an
 obvious manner.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our view is that in addition to verifying the universal properties of a
 model, one should also verify some non-universal properties, ideally with
 the view of being able to 
\emph on
infer
\emph default
 the parameters from data.
 In particular, due to the difficulty of obtaining observations, the inference
 must be efficient, and maximally use the information contained in a relatively
 small number of observations.

Chapter 2 is a continuation of the collaboration with the Jones group, started
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Clayton2007,Doupe2010"

\end_inset

, extending the understanding of progenitors in stratified squamous epithelium,
 in particular proposing a definite hierarchy of differentiation and parameters
 of progenitor turnover.
 The methodology allowed us to compare the difference between normal and
 drug-stressed tissue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 3 is a mostly theoretical diversion into some non-universal properties
 of branching processes where the number of cells increase.
 This is a model of cancer, and was indeed inspired by some 
\emph on
in vitro
\emph default
 work by the Jones group.
 In particular, since tumour cells in culture appear completely homogeneous
 and cell division is naturally constrained to be two daughter cells, the
 theory predicts that the non-universal limiting clone size distribution
 is determined by the cell cycle length.
 Thus one might hope that by measuring that distribution, it would be possible
 to infer the cell cycle length, and perhaps see evidence of failed attempts
 to differentiate, followed by a brief quiescence and then falling back
 into cell cycle again --- leading to a multi-model cycle distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 4 looks at some 
\emph on
in vitro
\emph default
 observations of rat retinal progenitors in collaboration with the Cayouette
 group.
 We found that even outside of homoeostatic/equilibrium environment, a purely
 stochastic model of progenitors is able to explain observed clones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 5 is a continuation of retina in development, with the Harris group.
 The availability of 
\emph on
in vivo
\emph default
 clones of developing embryos provided a rich but challenging dataset.
 Whilst a stochastic model seems capable of explaining the gross size and
 composition of clones, it is necessary more descriptive than prescriptive.

Previous collaboration between the Jones group and AMK and BDS

 focused on interfollicular epidermis (IFE) in mice.
 The IFE is a simple tissue, composed of multiple layers of keratinocytes,
 sitting atop a membrane that separates it from the rest of the muscle and
 mucosa that forms a substrate.
 Proliferation is confined to the basal layer of cells; upon differentiation,
 the cells stratify from the basal layer, lose their nucleus and much cellular
 machinery to turn into large, flat cells which are no longer transcriptionally
 active.
 As such, it is suited as a relatively clean environment in which to dissect
 the functional behaviour of cells with regards to their fate choice, via
 lineage tracing by inducible genetic labelling techniques.
 Specifically, they used genetically modified mice which carry an fluorescent
 protein gene, muted by a stop-cassette; upon treatment with tamoxifen the
 gene is activated by deletion of the stop cassette, leading to the production
 of the dye in that cell and all its progeny.
 By using a very low does of tamoxifen, it is possible to reduce the rate
 of induction such that fluorescent cells are widely spaced, and thus at
 some later time each cluster of fluorescent progeny (henceforth referred
 to as clonal cluster, or clone) can be assumed to have come from a single
 progenitor.
 It is then possible to measure by counting the distribution of clone sizes.
 Their work demonstrated the existence of a fast-turnover, equipotent population
 of progenitors which is capable of maintaining the tissue.
 This was in direct contrast to textbook models of long-lived stem cells
 supporting columns of more differentiated cells, via a hierarchy of transit-amp
lifying cells, capped by large plates of terminally differentiated cells.
 In particular, the evidence rests on: visual observation of large, single-cell
 derived clones with rough boundaries

 which do not respect the boundaries of the top-level, fully keratinasized
 cells; and linear growth of average surviving clone size, even at 6 months
 or more.
 These 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

stylized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 facts emphatically disagree with the textbook model of transit amplification
 stages.
 Whilst it would be neat to believe that these newly identified progenitors
 are the totality of proliferating cells in stratified epithelium in general,
 discussion of this interpretation informally yielded some objections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Whilst the IFE is interesting, everyone knows that there exist long-lived
 stem cells at the base of the hair follicles themselves.
 In addition, there are experiments which show that single cell clones derived
 from these stem cells can extend to beyond the follicle, into the IFE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The experiments thus far do not exclude the possibility that there is a
 small population of quiescent/long-lived stem cells in the IFE, which do
 not show up in the data through a combined effect of statistics and experimenta
l methodology that do not label these cells.
 Presumably, outside of routine maintenance such as wound repair, these
 stem cells would activate and contribute to the excess tissue formation
 needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these objections, we set out to perform a more in-depth analysis
 of a homologous system in the oesophageal lining of adult mice.
 In particular, whilst the oesophageal epidermis is very similar to IFE
 in its structure, it lacks any gross anatomical features such as hair follicles
, instead being composed of an spatially and temporally homogeneous population
 of keratinocytes undergoing continuous division and loss.
 This way, we hope to bypass the issue of follicular stem cells by simply
 not having them.
 We set up a similar system of transgenic animals, with tamoxifen activated
 Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) for clonal labelling (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-pictures"

\end_inset

).
 In addition, we aimed to characterise the progenitor population further,
 by measuring the distribution of clone sizes not only as a univariate distribut
ion in basal cell count (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-raw"

\end_inset

), but also as a two-dimensional joint distribution of basal and suprabasal
 counts (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-joint-data"

\end_inset

); the details of this will be the main thrust of this chapter of the present
 work.
 We also challenged this methodology by quantitatively characterising the
 action of a drug (all-trans retinoic acid, or atRA) on the oesophageal
 epithelium.

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, we tried to address the issue of slow cycling cells in
 the oesophageal epidermis by a pulse-chase system of transgenic Doxycycline
 (DOX) induced Histone-2B enhanced green fluorescent protein (H2B-GFP).
 In this system, whilst DOX is given to the animal, cycling cells produce
 H2B-GFP, giving intense nuclear staining.
 Up withdrawal, the H2B-GFP is diluted only by cell division, thus after
 several typical cell cycles one would see very little high intensity H2B-GFP.
 Indeed, after 8 weeks, there were 561 label-retaining cells out of 140000
 basal cells, of which exactly zero expressed any keratinocyte marker ---
 the label-retaining cells were of different lineages such as the immune
 system.
 Quantitative measurements of dilution rate gave a rough estimate of cell
 cycle length of twice per week; as we shall see, this is what a purely
 clonal analysis also yields, but with higher accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the Jones group was able to develop a remarkable microendoscopic
 biopsy of mouse oesophagus, allowing 
\emph on
in vivo
\emph default
 observation of both tamoxifen-EYFP and DOX-H2B-GFP transgenics undergoing
 wound repair.
 By wounding already induced tamoxifen-EYPF transgenics, we could see the
 existence of clones which were elongated and fragmented towards the wound,
 indicating that the same cells which normally maintain the epithelium are
 responsible for wound repair.
 The DOX-H2B-GFP transgenics revealed that the excess dilution was even
 around the wound, indicating widespread recruitment, as opposed to some
 special sub-population of progenitors hitherto unidentified.
 Finally, pulse-chase systems with the proliferation marker EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-de
oxyuridine) at various stages after wounding showed reduced proliferation
 after the wound fully repairs, indicating that the progenitors revert back
 to a homoeostatic phase.

To isolate and quantify the behaviour of proliferating cells, we scored
 the number of basal cells in clones containing two or more cells (i.e.
 clones in which a proliferative cell was labelled at the start of the experimen
t) from 3 days to one year post-induction, by confocal imaging of oesophageal
 wholemounts (

 Previously, it has been shown that in a similar homoeostatic stratified
 squamous epithelium, interfollicular epidermis, a simple statistical characteri
zation can be used to both establish the equipotency of a self-renewing
 cell population, and elucidate the pattern of cell fate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 In particular, if self-renewal involves the stochastic loss and replacement
 of such progenitors, clones derived from these cells will undergo a process
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

neutral drift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which ongoing clonal loss is compensated by the expansion of adjacent
 clones.
 However complex is the underlying dynamics, such processes lead inexorably
 to the long-term scaling of the surviving clone size distribution, in which
 the chance of finding a clone with a size larger than some multiple of
 the average remains constant over time.

Cumulative clone size distribution shows convergence onto scaling behaviour

 The raw basal layer clone size distribution in

 is reproduced here as the cumulative clone size distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}(t)$
\end_inset

, plotted as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 divided by the average clone size for each timepoint.
 The cumulative distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}(t)$
\end_inset

 represents the probability of finding a surviving clone with a basal layer
 size larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 At times of 3 months or more post-induction, the data sets converge onto
 each other, a manifestation of long-term scaling behaviour.
 Combined with the observed homoeostatic nature of the turnover, such scaling
 behaviour shows that the self-renewing progenitor cells function as a functiona
lly equivalent population.
 The black curve denotes an exponential cumulative clone size distribution;
 the long-term behaviour predicted for any strategy involving population
 asymmetric self-renewal including the model discussed here (1-2).

Applied to the current dataset, the convergence of the basal layer clone
 size distribution onto a scaling form (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-scaling"

\end_inset

) both confirms the functional equivalence of the self-renewing progenitor
 cell population, and shows that the balance between their proliferation
 and differentiation is achieved on a population basis, and not at the level
 of individual cell divisions, i.e., in the course of turnover, some cells
 may undergo terminal division leading to loss while others may undergo
 symmetric duplication.
 Indeed, such behaviour is consistent with the observed heterogeneity in
 the clonal composition at short times, which reveals that, soon after induction
, all possible permutations of two-cell clones can be found (i.e.
 two basal cells, one basal and one suprabasal, and two suprabasal cells).
 The same degree of heterogeneity is apparent in larger clones (

Taken together, the results above suggest that, as in interfollicular epidermis,
 oesophageal epithelium is maintained by a single cycling progenitor cell
 population in which cell division can lead to all three possible fate outcomes;
 two daughters that go on to divide, two cells that exit cycle and then
 stratify out of the basal layer, or one daughter that goes on to divide
 and one that differentiates

.
 To assess the validity of this model, and to quantify the respective rates
 and probabilities, we must turn now to a more detailed analysis of the
 short-time data, prior to scaling, where signatures of the detailed dynamics
 can be elucidated.
 To prepare for this analysis, we must embed the progenitor cell dynamics
 into a parametrisation that includes the stratification and loss of terminally
 differentiated cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parametrising EP dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be concrete, we will suppose that the basal layer comprises a single
 population of cycling oesophageal progenitor cells (with proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

), and their differentiating progeny (with proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\rho$
\end_inset

), which remain in the basal layer without dividing until they stratify.
 If we assume that the progenitors divide with an average rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, and the differentiating cells stratify at an average rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, to achieve homoeostasis, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\rho=(1-\rho)\gamma$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the rate at which differentiated cells are generated in the basal layer
 must be perfectly matched by the rate at which they stratify into the suprabasa
l cell layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further specify the model, we must also define the distribution of cell
 cycle and stratification times.
 Here, for simplicity, we will suppose that division and stratification
 are both uncorrelated between successive events leading, in both cases,
 to an exponential (Poisson) time distribution, with averages set by the
 rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 While this assumption is surely unsafe (after all, cell division must be
 accompanied by a small refractory period before further division is possible),
 any degree of synchrony in the cell cycle or stratification timings will
 be rapidly erased from the clonal record over the timecourse.
 In particular, we expect features due to potential synchrony to be lost
 within experimental error bars after ca.
 1--2 rounds of division

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alongside the division and stratification rates, we must further specify
 the probabilities for the respective fate outcomes following division.
 Since both the labelled cell number and their composition is found to be
 conserved over the time course, any process of cell division must be consistent
 with homoeostatic turnover.
 Moreover, since, through scaling, EPs are seen to function as an equipotent
 cell population, we will therefore suppose that proliferation and differentiati
on is finely balanced so that, with probability, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, EP division results in two dividing cells, with probability, 
\begin_inset Formula $1-2r$
\end_inset

, one dividing and one non-dividing basal later cell, and with probability,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, two non-dividing basal layer cells.
 Although we cannot rule out a small contribution arising from perpendicular
 cell divisions resulting in the placement of one of the daughters directly
 into the suprabasal layer, given such divisions are observed to be rare,
 the effect of such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 divisions would again be impossible to resolve.
 Similarly, we will neglect apoptosis, which was found to be negligible
 in the basal layer

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the time-evolution of the basal layer population, along with
 the clonal fate data, is therefore fully characterized by three adjustable
 parameters, the division rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, the stratification rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, and the fraction of divisions that lead to symmetrical fate, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The progenitor cell fraction is then fixed by the rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\gamma/(\lambda+\gamma)$
\end_inset

.
 To fully characterize the behaviour of the 
\emph on
total
\emph default
 clone size, including suprabasal as well as basal cells, we must include
 a further parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, which defines the average rate at which suprabasal cells are shed from
 the tissue (once again, we will suppose for simplicity that the corresponding
 distribution of shedding times is Poisson).
 Fortunately, this additional parameter can be related directly to the division
 and stratification rates through the ratio of nucleated suprabasal to basal
 layer cells, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, which can be measured directly.
 Then, since the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flux
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of differentiated cells stratifying from the basal layer must be perfectly
 compensated by the flux of differentiated cells that are shed, we must
 have 
\begin_inset Formula $m\mu=\rho\lambda=\gamma\lambda/(\gamma+\lambda)$
\end_inset

, thereby providing a relation linking 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

Taken together, the EP cell model dynamics can be cast as a critical (i.e.

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 are defined above.
 As discussed above, we suppose that EP cell fate follows a pattern of intrinsic
 or cell-autonomous regulation in which the fate outcome following division
 is uncorrelated with the behaviour of neighbouring cells.
 In previous studies, it has been shown that, in the two-dimensional geometry
 pertinent to oesophageal epithelium, the long-term clonal dynamics is largely
 insensitive to this choice

This completes the specification of the cellular dynamics as a generalized
 branching-type process.
 In principle, we could further refine the modelling scheme to include aspects
 of the spatial regulation.
 However, our aim here is to establish and challenge the simplest model
 which is consistent with the observed range of clonal fate data.
 Indeed, we will find that, by itself, this model provides a faithful descriptio
n of the cellular dynamics over the timecourse of the experiment.
 To assess the integrity of the model, and to fit the three adjustable parameter
s, we will make use of a Bayesian approach.

Scaling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the EP cell paradigm, following induction, a differentiated
 basal or suprabasal cell would progressively stratify, lose its cell nucleus
 and be shed, providing only a transient contribution to the clonal dynamics.
 By contrast, a clone derived from an EP cell would progressively undergo
 chance expansion or contraction according to the fate choice of the constituent
 cells.
 As tissue turns over, the gradual extinction of some clones due to chance
 commitment to terminal differentiation will be perfectly compensated by
 the expansion of other clones.
 Analysis of the branching process shows that, over time, neutral drift
 dynamics leads to a progressive (linear) increase in the average size of
 the surviving clones, while the surviving fraction falls proportionally
 such that the total density of labelled cells remains constant (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-raw"

\end_inset

, inset middle left) (18).
 In this regime, the basal layer clone size distribution acquires a scaling
 behaviour (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-scaling"

\end_inset

) described above.
 In particular, the chance of finding a clone with more than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 basal layer cells, takes the form of an exponential 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp[-n/\langle n(t)\rangle]$
\end_inset

 where, according to the parameters of the model, the average basal layer
 clone size (i.e.
 the average size of the clone 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

footprint
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the basal layer) is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle n(t)\rangle\simeq t/\tau$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau=\rho/r\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the long-term scaling behaviour provides the means to extract the
 characteristic timescale 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (see below), the rapid convergence to this regime does not allow the individual
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 to be inferred reliably from the basal layer clone size distribution alone.
 Therefore, to properly validate the model, and effect a reliable fit of
 the parameters, we consider the full range of clonal fate data, short-term
 and long-term, basal and suprabasal.

\end_inset

 basal cells and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 suprabasal cells at time

 The stochastic nature of our model will predict probabilities

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

.
 One might approach the fit with a least-squares method to optimize the
 parameters.
 However, as a significant portion of our data lies in the tails with large
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, where the counts are small, we would have to employ complex methods such
 as ad-hoc binning or continuity corrections.
 In addition, given the difficulty of obtaining large sample sizes, we needed
 a procedure which would maximise the value of the experiments, and perform
 optimal inference from them.
 As such, we have elected to use a more Bayesian approach, which also allows
 us to analyse the experiment with no manipulation of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fit the model to the range of experimental data, we implement a basic
 algorithm involving Bayes' theorem for updating prior probabilities in
 the presence of data.
 More precisely, the probability that the observed clonal fate data 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is described by the model is specified by the proportionality, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(\lambda,r,\rho|D\right)\propto P\left(D|\lambda,r,\rho\right)P\left(\lambda,r,\rho\right),
\]

\end_inset

where the posterior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(D|\lambda,r,\rho)$
\end_inset

 denotes the probability of obtaining the data 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 given the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, multiplied by the likelihood that the parameters are given by those same
 values.
 The constant of proportionality may be calculated 
\emph on
a posteriori
\emph default
 by imposing the normalisation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{\infty}\! d\lambda\int_{0}^{1}\! d\rho\int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2}}\! dr\, P\left(\lambda,r,\rho|D\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 In our case, the posterior distributions will turn out to be approximately
 Gaussian, so we may characterize the distribution by its first two moments
 and treat them as a point estimate for the parameters, and a credible interval
 covering approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $68\%$
\end_inset

 (using one standard deviation) or 
\begin_inset Formula $95\%$
\end_inset

 (using two).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Bayes' equation above, it is apparent that we need to specify a prior
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\lambda,r,\rho\right)$
\end_inset

 and a likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(D\middle|\lambda,r,\rho\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We chose the maximum entropy prior as we have no further cogent information,
 which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 uniform on the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 uniform on the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 log-uniform.
 Crucially, since we have sufficient data, the likelihood function is sharply
 peaked and only significant on a small support, and thus the posterior
 distribution is dominated by the likelihood function, and so any reasonable
 prior (one which does not fluctuate strongly over that narrow support)
 would give quantitatively similar results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to the likelihood function, since each observed clone is independent,
 it is a multinomial distribution with a countable number of outcomes: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(D\middle|\lambda,r,\rho\right)=\prod_{t}\frac{\left[\sum_{bn}f_{bn}(t)\right]!}{\prod_{bn}\left[f_{bn}(t)!\right]}\prod_{bn}\left[p_{bn}(t)\right]^{f_{bn}(t)},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}(t)$
\end_inset

 denote the expected probabilities that a clone contains 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 basal cells and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 suprabasal cells at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 post-induction.
 In the following, we will suppress the time index 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 for notational concision where it is considered unambiguous.
 To eliminate potential ambiguities due to uncertain induction frequencies
 of the two cell types, we conditioned the data on having at least two cells,
 which removes the events where a differentiated cell is induced.
 Moreover, to focus on a defined population, we further consider only clones
 which retain at least one basal layer cell.
 Thus we consider the probabilities, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{bn}\mapsto\tilde{p}_{bn}=\begin{cases}
0 & b=0\textrm{ or }b+n<2,\\
\frac{p_{bn}}{1-p_{10}-\sum_{n}p_{0n}} & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

, we consider the more fundamental distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

 describing the (unconditioned) probability of finding a clone with 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 progenitors, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 differentiated basal layer cells and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 suprabasal cells.
 From these probabilities we can determine 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 through the relation, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}=\sum_{l+m=b}p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

.
 The probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

 obey a continuous time Markov process, with the time-evolution given by
 the Master equation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}p_{lmn} & =\lambda\left[r(l-1)p_{(l-1)mn}+(1-2r)lp_{l(m-1)n}+r(l+1)p_{(l+1)(m-2)n}-lp_{lmn}\right]\\
 & +\gamma\left[(m+1)p_{l(m+1)(n-1)}-mp_{lmn}\right]-\mu np_{lmn}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with the initial conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}=\delta_{l1}\delta_{m0}\delta_{n0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although this is a straightforward set of coupled differential equations,
 direct numerical solution is prohibitively computationally expensive because
 each element is coupled to all the others: attempts to truncate the 
\begin_inset Formula $lmn$
\end_inset

-space causes errors that are hard to control.
 Instead, to develop the computational scheme, it is helpful to package
 the equations into the form of a generating function, 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,y,z,t)=\sum_{lmn}p_{lmn}(t)x^{l}y^{m}z^{n}$
\end_inset

, which obeys the differential equation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} & =\lambda\left[rx^{2}+(1-2r)xy+ry^{2}-x\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}+\gamma\left(z-y\right)\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+\mu(1-z)\frac{\partial G}{\partial z},\\
 & =\lambda\left[f_{x}(x,y,z)-x\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}+\gamma\left[f_{y}(x,y,z)-y\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+\mu\left[f_{z}(x,y,z)-z\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial z}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,y,z,t=0)=x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
f_{x}(x,y,z) & =rx^{2}+(1-2r)xy+ry^{2},\\
f_{y}(x,y,z) & =z,\\
f_{z}(x,y,z) & =1

\end_inset

which can be recognised as the probability generating functions for individual
 divisions of each cell type.

\begin_layout Standard
The partial differential equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 may be solved by the method of characteristics.
 Introducing the auxiliary equations, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}F_{v}(\mathbf{v},t)=a_{v}\left[f_{v}\left(F_{x},F_{y},F_{z}\right)-v\right]

\begin_inset Formula $v$

 ranges over the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{v}$
\end_inset

 ranges over 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\lambda,\gamma,\mu\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{v}(\mathbf{v},t=0)$
\end_inset

 ranges over 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

, we can write the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,y,z,t)=F_{x}(x,y,z,t)$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, we can recognize the auxiliary function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{v}$
\end_inset

 as the probability generating functions for the clone size distribution
 starting with a cell of type 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

 may be extracted from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 by complex analysis.
 Indeed, it is possible to directly extract 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 by considering 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,x,z,t)$
\end_inset

.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(x,y,t)=G(x,x,y,t)=\sum_{bn}p_{bn}(t)x^{b}y^{n},
\]

\end_inset

we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is analytic in both 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 on the complex unit disc 
\begin_inset Formula $|x|,|y|\le1$
\end_inset

, and so there are no poles within it.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 to be an anticlockwise contour around the unit circle, we can recover 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 by considering residues at zero: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{bn}(t)=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^{2}\oint_{\mathcal{C}}dx\oint_{\mathcal{C}}dy\frac{H(x,y,t)}{x^{b+1}y^{n+1}}.
\]

\end_inset

Note that, up to a minus sign, it is just a multi-dimensional inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-transform.
 The integral can be approached by a sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{bn}(t)=\lim_{M\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\sum_{k=1}^{M}H\left(e^{2\pi ij/M},e^{2\pi ik/M},t\right)e^{-2\pi ijb/M}e^{-2\pi ikn/M}
\]

\end_inset

the truncation of which at finite 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 approximates the integral and is in the form of a two-dimensional discrete
 Fourier transform.
 This allows the use of industrial Fast Fourier Transforms to evaluate all
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 being a power of two simultaneously.
 We use adaptive oversampling to estimate the error in the truncation, and
 use it to bound the errors.
 This gives a robust black box algorithm which gives point estimates and
 credible intervals for arbitrary clonal data sets.

Before finally carrying out the parameter estimation, it is important to
 confirm that the degree of inter-mouse variation is sufficiently small
 to justify collating data from different mice.
 For this purpose, we made use of the long-term scaling behaviour of the
 clone size distribution.
 Although, generically, the dynamics of the basal layer cells depends independen
tly on the three adjustable parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, in the scaling limit, the basal layer clone size depends only on the only
 on the combination, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau=r\lambda/\rho$
\end_inset

, a measure of the rate of progenitor cell loss and replacement.
 As a result, this parameter can be estimated with a smaller uncertainty,
 allowing it to be inferred on a mouse by mouse basis for each timepoint.
 Inferring this parameter from the basal layer clone size distribution,
 as well as the total clone size at shorter times, the comparison shown
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 reveal that, although there is some degree of inter-mouse variation, the
 amalgamation of data from different mice at the same timepoint can be justified.

 which fits within the experimental error, with only one parameter, the

With the parameters for normal and atRA treated tissue in hand, it is then
 possible to predict the outcome when atRA is applied after induction.
 In particular, if we assume that, following atRA treatment, the division
 and stratification rates immediately adjust from their normal to atRA treated
 steady-state values, we can predict the resulting clone dynamics.
 Indeed, when compared to the measured basal clone distribution, we find
 that the predictions offer a favourable fit (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

 By contrast, comparison with the joint suprabasal and basal distribution
 shows significant deviations (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-atra-jump"

\end_inset

, right).
 This departure can be easily understood as the effect of atRA treatment
 on cells which have already stratified and left the basal layer is more
 complex, and there may be some time-lag before the entire tissue changes
 to the new steady-state behaviour.
 Nevertheless, these results suggests that, as far as the basal layer is
 concerned, the application of atRA treatment can be well-approximated as
 an instantaneous change of the parameters of the EP cell dynamics.

Single cell clones

Finally, the development of the EP model relied upon the observation of
 long-term scaling behaviour of the basal layer clone size distribution
 which suggested that tissue maintenance involves only a single equipotent
 progenitor cell population.
 However, by focusing on clones with a total size greater than one, we eliminate
d the potential signature of a second very slow-cycling or quiescent cell
 population.
 Although the existence of such a population in oesophageal epithelium was
 ruled out by the H2B-GFP assay, with the predictions of the EP model, we
 can do back and question whether the dynamics of the single-cell clones
 are consistent with the ansatz of the modelling scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since, for times in greatly in excess of the cell stratification time,

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that there is a population of progenitors in oesophageal epitheliu
m which maintains the tissue, which can be quantitatively modelled by a
 simple stochastic branching process.
 The progenitors divide at a constant rate and chose one of three fates
 with fixed probabilities; differentiated cells stratify and eventually
 shed.
 The model contains four parameters: the EP cell division rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, the ratio of symmetric to asymmetric cell divisions controlled by the
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, the stratification rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, and the loss rate of cells from tissue 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 The latter is fixed by the ratio of basal to suprabasal cells, which may
 be accurately measured; the other three were measured from observed clone
 size distributions.
 Moreover, we have shown that this model can capture the effect of atRA
 treatment through a straightforward adjustment of the average EP cell division
 rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is interesting to note we have evidence that 
\begin_inset Formula $r\neq\frac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

 (with very high confidence), which implies that the fate of sister cells
 are not independent.
 In other words, it is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the case that a progenitor divides and each daughter cell independently
 chooses to differentiate.
 As such, either the decision is made prior to division (potentially via
 some asymmetric division of nuclear material) or post-mitosis by mutual
 inhibition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious extension of the present model is to incorporate some interaction
 effect between cells.
 As noted in the Introduction, such a model would naturally fall into the
 voter model universality class, which has the same exponential clone size
 distribution, but with a characteristic 
\begin_inset Formula $t/\log(t)$
\end_inset

 scaling for average surviving clone size.
 The data here does not support such a scaling relation, although it is
 possible that in the asymptotic regime where 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is large, the extra factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(t)$
\end_inset

 is too close to a constant to be experimentally distinguished.
 Furthermore, if the interactions extend over 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 cell diameters, then the asymptotic regime will be delayed by a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda d$
\end_inset

 which will remove traces of it from the short time behaviour (whilst the
 typical clone radius is smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, it does not know that the tissue is 2-dimensionally, and behaves in the
 mean-field fashion).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combined with the qualitative biological observations mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:ee-background-and-motivation"

\end_inset

, we believe these progenitors to be the totality of proliferating cells
 in the oesophageal epithelium, and are responsible for repair by switching
 reversibly to a different program of fate choice, biased towards proliferation.
 Furthermore, we conjecture that this mechanism is common to all keratinising
 stratified epithelia, such as IFE, though there may also be separate population
s of stem cells or progenitors which exist in particular anatomic niches.
 The quantitative behaviour is probably not universal, as far as the parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 are concerned, though it would be interesting if any of them turn out to
 be; clearly, accurate measurements of these parameters across a range of
 tissues is an immediate direction for future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further conjecture that there are a discrete number of such proliferation
 programs, as opposed to continuously adjustable parameters, based on the
 admittedly aesthetic belief that it is so important that maintenance is
 properly homoeostatic (since any deviation would need to be exponentially
 small to be survivable over a finite lifespan) that it is precisely prescribed
 by a separate underlying chemical pathway.
 In other words, there exist distinct phases of cell kinetics, which may
 be amenable to similar quantitative analysis.
 So far, we have only elucidated the behaviour of the homoeostatic phase,
 and have observed for the first time the repair phase 
\emph on
in vivo
\emph default
.
 Quantitative understanding of the latter should be a rich arena for future
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also take this opportunity to comment on an issue not in the published
 literature at all.
 In previous work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Clayton2007,Doupe2010"

\end_inset

, the parameters of the model were estimated in a different manner.
 Recall that to define the model one needs three measurements.
 The overall asymptotic rate 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau=r\lambda/\rho$
\end_inset

 was estimated from the asymptotic regime, and could be measured with reasonable
 accuracy.
 The proportion of progenitors in the basal layer 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 was estimated by means of cell markers, in particular Ki67 was used as
 a marker for proliferation; this choice is fairly standard in work on keratinoc
ytes.
 This gave the combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $r\lambda$
\end_inset

, and the final parameter was chosen to make the short-time, non-universal
 clone distribution agree with experiment.
 In the ear, this gave 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=22\%$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r=8\%$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\lambda\approx0.9\,\textrm{weeks}$
\end_inset

, a rate which agreed with existing estimates from more direct measurements.
 It was discovered early on in the course of this work that a similar procedure
 in oesophagus did 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
yield a sensible rate for the mean progenitor lifetime, especially in the
 presence of atRA; the discrepancy could be repaired if one assumed that
 Ki67 staining underestimates 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Careful experiments involving simultaneous staining of Ki67 and EdU in
 various pulse-chase scenarios confirmed that Ki67 was unreliable as an
 indicator of proliferation.
 Our private theory revolves around its specific role in RNA transcription,
 specifically how fast it turns off once commitment to differentiation is
 made; it is plausible that during an extended period after the decision
 is made, the cell is still transcriptionally active as it completely changes
 its behaviour.
 We hypothesized that the bias is worse in faster cycling tissues --- oesophagus
 in normal state has 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\lambda=0.5\,\textrm{weeks}$
\end_inset

 which decreases further to almost quarter of a week with atRA.
 Indeed, it was partially this problem which motivated the methodology eventuall
y taken, which infers the parameters of the model completely independently
 from any biological markers, but purely from the observed fate outcome
 in terms of clone sizes; the cost is the need to gather not only the distributi
on of number of basal cells, but the joint distribution with suprabasal
 cells as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a general point, we believe that this pivot away from biological markers
 is a good thing, and complementary to existing practices.
 Fundamentally, there is no such thing as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proliferation marker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

differentiation marker

keratinocyte
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 versus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hematopoietic marker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They are simple antibodies which attach to particular molecules that we
 have imposed a narrative upon.
 Those molecules exist momentarily, but we try to assign teleological function
 to them; we should not be amazed that this can work, and not surprised
 when it fails a little.
 Many experiments, for instance in the context of cancer, rely on the qualitativ
e response from Ki67 as evidence of greater or lesser proliferation.
 What we have observed is that in the limit of very fast cycle, the link
 between proliferation and Ki67 response decouples and cannot be trusted
 on a quantitative level.
 The Jones group is continuing this line of investigation, and trying to
 find more robust candidates for detecting proliferation, using the parameters
 derived in this work as the baseline for comparison.

Theorems on 1-Type Super-critical Branching Processes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in Chapter 1, there is a remarkable theorem that, in the long
 time limit for a 
\emph on
critical branching process
\emph default
 (where each cell leave on average the exact same number of cells in the
 next generation), the scaled clone size distribution is exponential and
 the average clone size conditioned on survival grows linearly with time.
 The statement makes no other assumptions, and is a prototypical example
 of universality.
 Observation of this universality was crucial, in epithelia, to strongly
 suggest that such a simple stochastic process is possible for generating
 the tissue.
 Further observation of the expected non-universal helps to confirm, as
 well as elucidate some finer aspects of the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If instead of exactly replenishing the number of proliferating cells, on
 average the number of cells increase, then we have a 
\emph on
super-critical process
\emph default
; then, as one might naively expect, the average clone size increases without
 bound, exponentially as a function of time.
 Whilst an exact exponential cannot be sustained for any period of time
 in a biologically realistic scenario, we might hope that it persists for
 long enough that we can be satisfied that there is an underlying stochastic
 process, i.e.
 perhaps an order of magnitude between transient non-universal behaviour
 on the order of a few cell cycles, and eventual limits of growth due to
 space or nutrients, some tens of cell cycles later.
 In particular, we are thinking of cancer like proliferation, both in live
 animals and in culture, where potentially a breakdown in the regulatory
 mechanism particularly lends itself to such a model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From informal discussions with the Jones group regarding possible mechanisms
 of regulatory failure, various experiments circumstantially implicated
 a failure to differentiate as a crucial step.
 Specifically, we expected to see progenitor cells 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attempt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to differentiate, but then fall back into cycle after a long period of
 apparent quiescence.
 Note that this behaviour care be fairly subtle: it is very easy for the
 
\emph on
typical
\emph default
 (median) or even 
\emph on
average
\emph default
 (mean) cell cycle to be unaffected to within experimental error, yet for
 the overall process to diverge dramatically from homoeostasis.
 Thus, it is absolutely necessary to be able to measure the 
\emph on
distribution
\emph default
 of cell cycles, or at the very least find evidence of particularly long
 cycles compared to the typical one.
 However, direct measurement of the distribution is problematic, especially
 in live animals, but even 
\emph on
in vitro
\emph default
.
 Given a typical cell cycle of days to weeks, direct imaging is almost impossibl
e.
 Cunning combinations of multiple simultaneous pulse-chase protocols may
 be sufficient, but aside from difficulties in gathering sufficient data
 (multiply labelled cells from low-level induction events are rare), one
 also experiences contaminating side-effects of prolonged exposure to fundamenta
lly mutagenic reagents such as BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine).
 Given our experience with clone size distributions, we thus became interested
 in the link between cell cycle times and the limit distribution of (scaled)
 clone sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concretely, let a branching process be composed of equipotent cells, with
 lifetime distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Upon division, each cell with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 will yield 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 daughters: we will consider generalised cells in this chapter; realistically
 
\begin_inset Formula $k\le2$
\end_inset

.
 Let us package that into a generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)=\sum_{k}p_{k}s^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 We will restrict ourselves to biologically feasible processes, in particular
 we will require all moments of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 to exist.
 Furthermore, we will assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, as it simplifies the consideration by avoiding total death of the clone;
 for any given 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 we can construct a 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\star}$
\end_inset

 of equal order such that no death occurs, with the only difference being
 the existence of terminal clones (see appendix
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:condition-survival"

\end_inset

).
 We also exclude certain pathological behaviours from consideration, such

 excludes in particular the existence of a Dirac delta spike at zero in

 The average number of progeny per cell is

\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(1)>1$
\end_inset

, which we will assume for the rest of this chapter.
 There are then some classic theorems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 about such processes: the average clone size diverges exponentially with
 a

\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left[f,g\right]$
\end_inset

 defined to be the (only) positive root of
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha y}g(y)\, dy=1;
\]

\end_inset

and in the limit of infinite time, the distribution (normalised to unit
 mean) of the total number of cells converges to a distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

, whose characteristic function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(u)=\mathbb{E}\left[e^{iuW}\right]$
\end_inset

 is the unique solution (amongst distributions with unit mean) of
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi(u)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f\left[\phi\left(ue^{-\alpha y}\right)\right]g(y)\, dy.\label{eq:forwards-eq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Notice that since the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 sets a scale for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, we may remove it by scaling 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 with no change to the limiting behaviour.
 Therefore without loss of generality we shall set

Whilst the general result has been known for a while, specific solutions

\begin_inset Formula $(g(t)=e^{-t/\tau}$

\end_inset

 In both these cases, the biologically interesting situation where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)=as+bs^{2}$
\end_inset

 are not interesting in the limiting clone size distribution: in continuous
 time this is an exponential, and in discrete time this can be an exponential
 (if 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

, strictly, becoming equivalent to the continuous Markov process in the
 limit) or a degenerate point mass if

In this chapter, we tackle the problem both numerically and analytically,
 to understand

 as a non-linear integral transform on distributions over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{+}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$

 We seek to infer the cell cycle distribution from the measurable clone
 size distribution.
 Concretely, we attempt to invert the relationship between the cell cycle
 distribution and the clone size distribution, and investigate its stability
 and (un)suitability as a practical procedure.
 Along the way we find that not all distributions can arise as the limiting
 distribution of a super-critical branching process, and we conjecture and
 prove some properties of them.

Examples of limiting distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can consider equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

 as a family of non-linear transforms on the space of distributions over
 the positive reals, between 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

, indexed by the generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 We note two properties (see appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:injective-continuity"

\end_inset

) in particular: it is continuous (in 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

-norm), and injective (for a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, up to scaling of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

).
 In particular, this implies that if we know the branching of cells (which
 for biological applications we can obtain by experiment), it is 
\emph on
in principle
\emph default
 possible to undo the transform and infer the cell cycle length from experimenta
l clone size distributions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

, treated as an iterative procedure, is stable and convergent.
 However, numerical implementation will have to deal with the inevitable
 deviation from the manifold of proper characteristic functions.
 In practice, we find that it is sufficient to use a cubic spline approximation
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, and clamp the boundary at the origin: 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(0)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{\prime}(0)=i$
\end_inset

.
 With an initial guess corresponding to an exponential distribution for
 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, this reliably converges to a distribution, although the mean often deviates
 from unity by a few percent.
 The convergence is fast enough to be interactive and allow numerical experiment
s, but only just.
 We show some examples here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we consider a simple binary fission 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)=s^{2}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

-distributed cell cycles
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\frac{\beta^{\beta}t^{\beta-1}e^{-\beta t}}{\Gamma(\beta)}.
\]

\end_inset

The limiting distributions (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) are remarkably close to being 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

-distributed also, but not quite (inset).
 As we show in appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

-distributions are legitimate limiting distributions, but to a slightly
 different cell cycle distribution.

\begin_layout Standard
Since the transform in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

 is continuous, the limit distribution will not change qualitatively for
 moderate changes to the cell cycle distribution.
 In particular, the biologically relevant example of a mono-modal distribution
 with an initial refractory period is sufficiently close to give very similar
 limit distributions.
 In any case, since the right tail is always exponential (appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:moment-theorems"

\end_inset

), the only qualitative change possible is the behaviour near the origin,
 i.e.
 increase the proportion of clones smaller than the average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we may consider a process where the division of each cell can produce
 a large number of progeny relative to the average.
 Specifically, consider 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(s)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{s^{k}}{2^{k}}=\frac{s}{s-2}.
\]

\end_inset

 For the Markovian process it is possible 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "III.8, theorem 3"
key "Athreya2004"

\end_inset

 to analytically obtain the limit distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(W)=\frac{1}{2}\left[-1+\frac{2e^{-W/4}}{\sqrt{\pi}\sqrt{W}}+\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sqrt{W}}{2}\right)\right],
\]

\end_inset

which has a weak divergence at the origin.
 More intuitively, if we consider the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(W)$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
J(s)=H\left(e^{s}\right)e^{s} & =\frac{e^{\frac{s}{2}-\frac{e^{s}}{4}}}{\sqrt{\pi}}-\frac{1}{2}e^{s}\mathrm{erfc}\left(\frac{e^{s/2}}{2}\right)\\
 & \sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{s/2}\textrm{, }s\rightarrow-\infty,
\end{align*}

\end_inset

we see that it still decays exponentially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, we can simply have some cells which divide very slowly.
 In particular, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:g-power-limits"

\end_inset

 shows the limit distributions for binary fission with the family 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(t)=\frac{\mathrm{sinc}\left(\frac{n}{\pi}\right)}{1+\left(t-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}}\Theta\left(t-\frac{1}{2}\right),\ n\ge2.\label{eq:power-law-g}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As can be seen in the inset, the corresponding distribution in 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(W)$
\end_inset

 has a power-law tail for small 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

, implying a divergence 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(W)\approx\frac{C}{W\,\log^{n}(W)},\ W\rightarrow0.
\]

\end_inset

Notice however, that the local minimum in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 becomes closer to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, and the divergence at the origin become more narrow.
 If we impose an upper-end cut-off to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

, then the divergence is removed, without significant changes to the rest
 of the curve.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{\tilde{h}(\omega)}{\widetilde{f\odot h}(\omega)},\label{eq:backward-eq}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\odot h$
\end_inset

 is the composition of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 followed by 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{t\rightarrow-\infty}h(t)=\phi(0)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is not integrable.
 Furthermore, since 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

 considered as a distribution on the entire real line almost certainly has
 discontinuities in its derivatives at the origin, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(u)$
\end_inset

 will have algebraic decay for large 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)\in O\left(e^{-ct}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, for some finite 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the Fourier transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h}$
\end_inset

 will only converge and thus be defined on the strip 
\begin_inset Formula $-c<\Im\left(\omega\right)<0$
\end_inset

 (the strip will be as least as wide for 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{f\odot h}$
\end_inset

: the higher powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{k}$
\end_inset

 will widen the strip to 
\begin_inset Formula $kc$
\end_inset

, thus the intersection will be determined by the smallest order term in
 the expansion).
 Thus for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 to be well-defined, we require that the quotient in the inversion formula
 be analytically extended to include the real line, and give a characteristic
 function on it; in addition, it must be entirely analytic in the lower
 half-plane in order for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 to be causal, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t<0$
\end_inset

, and be asymptotically zero at negative imaginary infinity for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 to be integrable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore we are led to study what exactly is the image of the transform
 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

, equivalently the domain of the Klein formula.
 We can show than the tail of 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

 is bounded from above by any power-law decay and from below by an exponential,
 and conjecture that it is in fact exactly exponential (

\begin_layout Standard
However, the requirement that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 be positive and thus a probability distribution is difficult to deal with
 analytically.
 In Fourier space, it is requiring 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 be a proper characteristic function, which has a complex and non-local
 statement via a specialisation of Bochner's theorem, specifically that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 be positive-definite.

Positive-definiteness for a function is related to positive-definiteness
 for a matrix.
 In particular, if for any 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}$
\end_inset

, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with elements 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}=f\left(x_{i}-x_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 is positive semi-definite, then 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is positive-definite.
 Notice that as this subsumes many well-known properties of characteristic
 functions.
 For example, with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0)$
\end_inset

 must be real (in fact, for normalisation, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0)=1$
\end_inset

), and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\overline{f(x)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|f(x)\right|\le f(0)$
\end_inset

.
 Higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 impose ever more complex and hard-to-verify conditions.

 We therefore proceed by considering some specific examples to gain a better
 intuition regarding possible solutions.

Delta distribution

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)=\delta(W-1)$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(u)=e^{iu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)=e^{ie^{t}}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h}(\omega)=e^{\pi\omega/2}\Gamma\left(-i\omega\right)$
\end_inset

, defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\Im(\omega)<1$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(s)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_{k}s^{k}
\]

\end_inset

 (notice that we do not have a constant term), 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widetilde{f\odot h}(\omega)=e^{\pi\omega/2}\Gamma\left(-i\omega\right)\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_{k}k^{i\omega}
\]

\end_inset

defined on the same strip.
 The quotient is then well defined:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_{k}k^{i\omega}}.
\]

\end_inset

If only one 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero (and therefore equal to one), we would have a well-defined
 distribution
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\delta(t-\ln k),
\]

\end_inset

which reproduces the trivial result that a discrete time Markovian process
 with fixed outcomes in each division necessarily leads to a Dirac distribution
 as the limit.
 For a more generic 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 it does not lead to a probability distribution.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Exponential tailed distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As conjectured, the tail of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is always exponential (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "app:moment-theorems"

\end_inset

).
 With the integral above we can consider the very general class of some
 polynomial multiplied by an exponential.
 For reasons that will become apparent, we write it as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(W)=\sum_{k}a_{k}\frac{\lambda^{k+1}}{\Gamma(k+1)}W^{k}e^{-\lambda W}
\]

\end_inset

where normalisation requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}a_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 and unity mean requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}a_{k}(k+1)/\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, though as we shall see the latter will be automatically enforced.
 The characteristic function is very helpfully just a sum, and the complicated
 factors above all cancel:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi(u)=\sum_{k}a_{k}\left(1-\frac{iu}{\lambda}\right)^{-k-1}.
\]

\end_inset

Importantly, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\odot\phi$
\end_inset

 has the same structure, composed of a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-iu/\lambda)^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we only have to consider a single integral (convergent on 
\begin_inset Formula $-k-1<\Im\{\omega\}<0$
\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i\omega t}\left(1-\frac{ie^{t}}{\lambda}\right)^{-k-1}dt\\
= & \lambda^{i\omega}\int_{0}^{\infty}z^{i\omega-1}(1-iz)^{-k-1}dz\\
= & \lambda^{i\omega}e^{-\pi\omega/2}\frac{\Gamma\left(1+k-i\omega\right)\Gamma\left(i\omega\right)}{\Gamma(1+k)}\\
= & \lambda^{i\omega}e^{-\pi\omega/2}\Gamma(1-i\omega)\Gamma\left(i\omega\right)\frac{\left(1-i\omega\right)_{k}}{\Gamma(1+k)}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z\right)_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the Pochhammer symbol.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:backward-eq"

\end_inset

, upon taking the quotient all but the last factor above cancel.
 Define the auxiliary polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z)=\sum_{k}a_{k}z^{k}$
\end_inset

 (with all real coefficients) and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(z)=\frac{1}{z}f\left[zP(z)\right]$
\end_inset

 and a transform on polynomials defined by being linear and acts on each
 monomial as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{z^{k}}\Longrightarrow\frac{(1+z)_{k}}{\Gamma(k+1)}.
\]

\end_inset

Then by linearity we immediately get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{\widehat{P}(-i\omega)}{\widehat{Q}(-i\omega)}.
\]

\end_inset

Notice that the formula above is completely independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

; the correct one such that 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

 has mean of unity will be chosen.
 We can find 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 by applying the Heaviside formula to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}(iz)$
\end_inset

 (treating it as an inverse Laplace transform), and generically it will
 be a sum of exponentials (possibly with complex exponents, but always occurring
 in conjugate pairs as 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

 are real), determined by the locations of zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that whilst 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}(z)$
\end_inset

 cannot have any zeros on the positive real line, generically there may
 be zeros on the right half plane.
 Below, we will try and give some simple cases where this can be done and
 it yields proper cell cycle distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest case is 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)=e^{-W}$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(z)=\frac{1}{z}f(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sum_{k}p_{k}(1-i\omega)_{k-1}/\Gamma(k)}.
\]

\end_inset

If only one 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=(k-1)e^{-(k-1)t}\left(e^{t}-1\right)^{k-2}.
\]

\end_inset

In particular this reproduces the result that for binary fission (
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

) the Markovian process (
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)=e^{-t}$
\end_inset

) gives an exponential distribution in the limit.
 Biologically cells can only divide into two, so we can consider 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=(1-r)z+rz^{2}.$
\end_inset

 In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\frac{1}{r}e^{-t/r},
\]

\end_inset

 which is again Markovian, and, in hindsight obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another simple case is when 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

-distribution; in that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z)=z^{\beta-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(z)=\frac{1}{z}f\left(\beta^{\beta}z^{\beta}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We get
\begin_inset Formula

 All three roots have negative real parts for 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gtrsim0.106383$

A practical application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interesting data set come from Ruth Verstraten (Jones group) involving
 cultured human cervical cells infected by various strains of human papillomavir
us (HPV).
 We now analyse such a data set, where a particular strain (HPV16) has been
 incorporated into the genetic material of the host, leading to sustained
 proliferation in culture.
 The data was generated from 301 such single-cell derived clones cultured
 for 8 weeks; the largest of which are over 1000 cells, the smallest only
 4 cells.
 Each clone was also stained for MCM2 (minichromosome maintenance complex
 component 2) and EdU uptake over the last 24 hours, as an indication of
 proliferation (our reservations regarding markers in general notwithstanding).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A striking feature of the data is that most cells are cycling: 
\begin_inset Formula $90.9\%$
\end_inset

 are MCM2-positive, and 
\begin_inset Formula $87.4\%$
\end_inset

 are EdU-positive.
 The smallest clone with positive staining for proliferation has only 7
 cells, 5 of which are MCM2-positive, 3 are EdU-positive; the largest is
 around 1250 cells, with 1184 MCM2-positive and 1178 EdU-positive.
 Whilst we can perform analysis on only the MCM2-positive or EdU-positive
 subpopulation to ensure that we are analysing only proliferating cells,
 it is our belief that at these extremely high levels of proliferation,
 the markers are not quantitatively accurate.
 It seems to us to be more likely that 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 cells are cycling, but with very large variations in cell cycle length,
 leading to the extremely broad distribution of clone sizes with marker-positive
 cells.
 In addition, if we believe that a potential mechanism is the failure of
 cells to differentiate, when we may indeed expect some under-counting from
 markers due to cells which are 
\emph on
trying
\emph default
 to differentiate and thereby not displaying the usual molecular signs of
 cell cycle, but later on fall back into cycle again.
 In any case, our analysis below does not substantially change with the
 choice of subpopulation, and we will assume that all cells are cycling
 and allow ourselves the full data set and avoid any experimental pathology
 due to the extra complication.

\begin_layout Standard
Making the simplifying assumption that each cell is independent and clones
 may be cultured indefinitely, we find ourselves considering a supercritical
 branching process with only one type of equipotent cell, and no apoptosis.
 Given the large average clone size (346 cells), we may consider ourselves
 to be in the asymptotic regime of large times, and may apply our work so
 far on limit distributions.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:ruth-cumulative-distribution"

\end_inset

 we see that as expected from general theorems on the distribution (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "app:moment-theorems"

\end_inset

) the tail is exponential, with the exception of very large clones (
\begin_inset Formula $>1000\,\textrm{cells}$
\end_inset

) which are slight under-represented due to finite time effects.
 We can also see that the small clones (
\begin_inset Formula $<200\,\textrm{cells}$
\end_inset

) are 
\emph on
approximately
\emph default
 uniformly distributed (as evidenced by a linear segment in the empirical
 cumulative distribution).
 And whilst the number of clone relative is small to the average size, the
 point-wise uniformity can be quite approximate indeed, nevertheless we
 can be fairly certain that it is not the case that 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(0^{+}\right)=0$

 Whilst the fits are quite good, we can also see that at the present level
 of accuracy, we cannot distinguish between the two theoretical possibilities.
 Indeed, a rough estimate based on the plausible intervals from the theoretical

 It seems that although we have derived some necessary conditions on acceptable

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have made some progress on understanding the precise class of limit distribut
ions which can arise from a 1-type supercritical branching process.
 In particular, we have shown that the tail of the distribution must be
 bounded from below by an exponential, and from above by any power-law;
 we conjecture that it must be exponential.
 We have also developed some numerical techniques which allow us to numerically
 solve 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

, and found cell cycle distributions which lead to a limit distribution
 that approximates a small data set from cultured HPV-incorporated cervical
 epithelial cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a formal formula for computing the cell cycle distribution from
 a given limit distribution, providing a partial solution to the inverse
 problem.
 Directly applying the formula (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "app:examples"

\end_inset

), we can reproduce the known results for the exponential (Markovian) process,
 and the discrete time process.
 In addition, we can concretely invert the gamma distribution.
 More generally, we can formally invert distributions of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)=p(W)e^{-\lambda W}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is some polynomial, although generically they do not yield proper distributions
 upon inversion.
 We conjecture that in the space of distributions, at a generic point in
 the image of the forwards transforms, almost all directions (i.e.
 perturbations) lead off the manifold; but nevertheless, there is a countable
 number of perturbations which remain on it.
 Clearly, it would be beneficial to have a more precise characterisation
 of the manifold, and a ripe area for future theoretical work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently however, the formula is not best suited for direct application
 to experimental data.
 Firstly, we do not have a full characterisation of the solution space of
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

, making it difficult to project an empirical distribution into the allowed
 manifold of solutions.
 Secondly, we suspect that the inverse problem is likely to be ill-conditioned
 (in some sense yet to be made precise) or possibly even ill-posed.
 Heuristically, because the transform in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

 is continuous, there is not a sharply optimal choice for an inverse that
 optimises some cost function (likelihood, for instance).
 In particular, numerical experiments show that changes to 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 which do not significantly change extreme behaviours tends to have negligible
 effect on the outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 The situation is likely analogous to the problem of inferring a distribution
 from a finite sample, where in the absence of further constraints or strong
 priors the problem is simply ill-posed.
 It is possible that some global 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shape constraint
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might be sufficient.
 For instance, we might impose the restriction that conditional rate of
 division is monotonically increasing as a function of cell lifetime; more
 precisely, defining the survival function as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S(t)=1-\int_{0}^{t}g(y)\, dy
\]

\end_inset

and the hazard function 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(t)=-\frac{S^{\prime}(t)}{S(t)}=\frac{g(t)}{S(t)},
\]

\end_inset

we require that 
\begin_inset Formula $H(t)$
\end_inset

 is a non-decreasing function of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 We suspect that a suitable discretisation of this constraint to render
 it finitary, with sufficient computation resources, could form the basis
 of a viable numerical technique to infer plausible cell cycles from measurement
s.
 More general shape constraints such as requiring 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 to be mono-modal or some fixed number of modes may also be viable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more serious impediment may come from the restriction to 1-type branching
 processes.
 It is known 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Athreya2004"

\end_inset

 that in a multi-type, super-critical branching process, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 cell types, Malthusian parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 , branching functions 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f^{(i)}\left(s_{1},\ldots,s_{\mu}\right)=\sum_{k_{1},\ldots,k_{\mu}}a_{k_{1},\ldots k_{\mu}}^{(i)}s_{1}^{k_{1}}\cdots s_{\mu}^{k_{\mu}}
\]

\end_inset

and lifetime functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{(i)}(t)$
\end_inset

, will converge to a clone size distribution that depends on the type of
 the initial cell, with a fixed ratio between different cell types (which
 also depend on the initial cell type).
 Specifically, letting 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{(i)}(u)$
\end_inset

 be the characteristic function of the limit distribution starting from
 a single cell of type 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, we have a system of coupled, non-linear integral equations:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi^{(i)}(u)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f^{(i)}\left[\phi^{(1)}\left(ue^{-\alpha y}\right),\ldots,\phi^{(\mu)}\left(ue^{-\alpha y}\right)\right]g^{(i)}(y)\, dy.\label{eq:horrible}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Whilst a similar formula to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:backward-eq"

\end_inset

 must exist, it would require knowledge of all the limit distributions,
 starting from different cell types.
 From an experimental point of view, this may be too much information to
 gather in the general case.
 It may still be possible to make progress on specific branching patterns,
 such as might be recapitulated by a failure to differentiate, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow A+B$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

.

Finally, it is unclear at the moment whether it may be possible to approximate
 a multi-type process as a 1-type process.
 Whilst the general case is probably answerable in the negative, we are
 more interested in cases such as above, where branching ratios are restricted
 and, e.g., one cell type is essentially a waiting room for falling back into
 cell cycle.
 In particular, we might expect some combination of multi-modal cell lifetimes
 to yield essentially the same limit distribution.

Assume that two different

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We may assume without loss of generality that their respective Malthusian
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are equal and unity (if they are not we can simply scale the cell cycle
 distributions).
 Then we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}f\left[\phi\left(e^{t-y}\right)\right]\left[g_{1}\left(y\right)-g_{2}\left(y\right)\right]dy=0,
\]

\end_inset

for all 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Using the trick of writing 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)=\phi\left(e^{t}\right),$
\end_inset

 and applying the convolution theorem we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widetilde{f\odot h}\left(\omega\right)\left[\tilde{g}_{1}\left(\omega\right)-\tilde{g}_{2}\left(\omega\right)\right]=0.
\]

\end_inset

As noted above in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "app:examples"

\end_inset

, this will only be well defined on some open strip below the real line.
 Nevertheless, on that open strip 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}_{1}\left(\omega\right)=\tilde{g}_{2}\left(\omega\right)$
\end_inset

, and thus, by analytic continuation, as characteristic functions they are
 equal, and the original functions 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

 are equal as distributions.

Continuity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We proceed by considering the continuity of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:backward-eq"

\end_inset

.
 Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)=h_{0}(t)+\delta u(t)$
\end_inset

 for some small 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

 and bounded 
\begin_inset Formula $u(t)$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left[h(t)\right]=f\left[h_{0}(t)\right]+\delta u\left(t\right)f^{\prime}\left[h_{0}\left(t\right)\right]=f\left[h_{0}(t)\right]+z(t)$
\end_inset

.
 We can then proceed formally, restricted to some strip below the real line:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\tilde{g}_{0}+\delta\tilde{g} & =\frac{\tilde{h}_{0}+\delta\tilde{u}}{\widetilde{f\odot h_{0}}+\delta\widetilde{z}}\\
 & =\frac{\tilde{h}_{0}+\delta\tilde{u}}{\widetilde{f\odot h_{0}}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\delta^{k}\left\{ \frac{\widetilde{z}}{\widetilde{f\odot h_{0}}}\right\} ^{k}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

On that strip, the original 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}_{0}=\frac{\tilde{h}_{0}}{\widetilde{f\odot h_{0}}}$
\end_inset

 is analytic, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{f\odot h_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is not zero.
 Furthermore, since 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(s)\le f^{\prime}(1)\equiv m$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $|s|\le1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|h_{0}\right|\le1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z\right|\le m\delta\left|u\right|$
\end_inset

, and the sum is indeed convergent.
 We can suitably bound 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

, and by continuity of the Fourier transform, bound 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 and

 Recognising these as moments (up to factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 which may be removed without loss of generality by picking the right boundary
 conditions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

) gives (using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{0}=\phi(0)=1$
\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{n}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\cdots k_{n}!}f^{(k)}\left(1\right)\left(\frac{M_{1}}{1!}\right)^{k_{1}}\cdots\left(\frac{M_{n}}{n!}\right)^{k_{n}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy.\label{eq:moment-recursion}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we assumed that all moments of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 exist, 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{(k)}(1)$
\end_inset

 will also exist.
 Noticing that there is only one partition with 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}=1$
\end_inset

, we can move that term to the left hand side and we get for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge2$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{n}\left[1-\int_{0}^{\infty}f^{\prime}(1)e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy\right]=C\left[M_{1},\ldots,M_{n-1}\right],
\]

\end_inset

where the right hand side only depends on the lower moments, and in particular
 is finite if all the lower moments are finite.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1=\int_{0}^{\infty}f^{\prime}(1)e^{-y}g(y)\, dy>\int_{0}^{\infty}f^{\prime}(1)e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy
\]

\end_inset

and since 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 is finite, by induction all moments exist.
 Thus, applying Chebychev's inequality we get 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)\in o\left(W^{-\alpha}\right)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 We conjecture that it is actually exponentially bounded, and show this
 below for binary fission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now outline an argument that the tails are also bounded from below by
 an exponential.
 First, generally if two non-negative variables 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{2}$
\end_inset

 have moments obeying
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[W_{1}^{n}\right]\ge\mathbb{E}\left[W_{2}^{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, then there exists a 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0}$
\end_inset

 such that for all 
\begin_inset Formula $w>w_{0}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left[W_{1}>w\right]\ge\mathbb{P}\left[W_{2}>w\right].
\]

\end_inset

To see this, consider the contrapositive, which is that if the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[W_{1}>w\right]<\mathbb{P}\left[W_{2}>w\right]$
\end_inset

 is unbounded, then for at least one 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[W_{1}^{n}\right]<\mathbb{E}\left[W_{2}^{n}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 We then check two cases: (a) if it there exist arbitrarily large 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[W_{1}>w\right]>\mathbb{P}\left[W_{2}>w\right]$
\end_inset

 then it would be a contradiction for the moments to be dominated 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, if the moments 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n}\right]\in n\log n+\Theta(n)$
\end_inset

 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 then the tail 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]$
\end_inset

 is exponential, in some sense.
 In particular, existing work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Abate1996"

\end_inset

 suggests that if the limits 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{n}=\frac{n\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n-1}\right]}{\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n}\right]}\rightarrow\eta
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{n}=\frac{\eta_{n}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n}\right]}{n!}\rightarrow A
\]

\end_inset

 exist, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{w\rightarrow\infty}e^{\eta w}\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]=A.
\]

\end_inset

 Finally, we consider equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:moment-recursion"

\end_inset

 and drop all terms higher than quadratic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{M_{n}}{n!}\ge\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{M_{k}M_{n-k}}{k!(n-k)!}\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}{1-f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}\label{eq:moments-lower-bound}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which follows as each term in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:moment-recursion"

\end_inset

 is positive.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(n)=M_{n}/n!$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xi(n)\ge\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\xi(k)\xi(n-k)K_{n},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
K_{n} & =\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}{1-f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}\\
 & >\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(1)}{1-f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2y}g(y)\, dy}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy\\
 & \ge C\eta^{-n}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

for some 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 Using the equality we can convert this into a lower bound 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{n}\ge\frac{n!}{C\eta^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

which by the above gives an exponential tail.
 Thus, we conclude that the tail of a limit distribution is exponentially
 bounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of binary fission, we can improve the upper bound slightly.
 In particular, the equality in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:moments-lower-bound"

\end_inset

 applies.
 An upper bound on the moments is then given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{K_{2}M_{n}}{n!}\le\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{K_{2}M_{k}}{k!}\frac{K_{2}M_{n-k}}{(n-k)!}.
\]

\end_inset

with equality for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\le2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{2}=\frac{2\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2y}g(y)\, dy}{1-2\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2y}g(y)\, dy}.
\]

\end_inset

We obtain an upper bound in terms of the Catalan numbers
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{K_{2}M_{n}}{n!}\le\frac{K_{2}^{n}(2n-2)!}{(n-1)!n!}
\]

\end_inset

Then applying the moments bound
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Philips1995"

\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]=\inf_{n}\frac{M_{n}}{w^{n}}\le\inf_{n}\frac{K_{2}^{n-1}(2n-2)!}{(n-1)!w^{n}},
\]

\end_inset

which for large 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]=O\left(\frac{1}{w}\right)e^{-\frac{w}{4K_{2}}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we note that removing the assumption that all moments of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 exist will remove the upper bound but not the exponential lower bound.
 Furthermore, if the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is infinite, then the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 will be as well, suggesting a tail 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)\approx W^{-k-1}$
\end_inset

; indeed, the moment will diverge at finite times.

Stochastic Fate Choice in Cultured Rat Retinal Progenitors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction and motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have seen, it is possible to have a stochastic process which describes
 in quantitative detail a homoeostatic stratified epithelium such as the
 oesophageal epithelium, or skin.
 Such an approach has also seen success in other tissues which undergo continuou
s replacement and renewal throughout adult life, such as in the sperm ducts
 [???] and intestines [???].
 However, the central nervous system (CNS) is fundamentally different, as
 most neurons are not replaced during adult life.
 Thus, we are dealing with a system which is not only not in homoeostasis,
 it is also very far from equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge that a tissue is under homoeostasis significantly restricts the
 possible behaviour of cells.
 In particular, we have at our disposal 
\emph on
universal
\emph default
 scaling relations about clone sizes and clone growth rates which anchor
 our interpretation of experimental observations.
 Given the confirmation of these universal properties, we are then almost
 forced to conclude a simple, stochastic model of fate choice, with assurances
 that deviations from this model are small and that they do not impact the
 macroscopic behaviour.
 Such models are therefore not only descriptive, but also predictive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relaxing homoeostasis to mere time-translation invariance allows for much
 greater variety of behaviour.
 For example, even without interaction, we have complex relations between
 clone size distributions and cell cycle lengths.
 With interactions, we can in principle have arbitrary reaction-diffusion
 systems, which are known [???] to be Turing-complete, and are therefore
 capable of simulating any other system.
 As such, we cannot hope to quantitatively bound the errors that our assumptions
 may induce, and any model we build could in principle be only valid within
 the experimental bounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, we can remain guided by arguments of simplicity and concordance:
 although we cannot categorically rule out alternatives, the simplest thing
 that seems to work is probably not too far from the truth.
 More concretely, we can at least provide a 
\emph on
null hypothesis
\emph default
 on which to compare more complex models.
 In particular, we have in mind the possibility that minor modifications
 to the basic concept of stochastic, independent fate choice can recapitulate
 observed behaviour, and form the basis of such a null hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The possibility that such a process could exist is given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cayouette2003"

\end_inset

, which showed that isolated cultured rat retinal progenitor cells (RPCs)
 will generate the same proportions of differentiated retinal cell types
 (both neuronal and ganglial) as 
\emph on
in vivo
\emph default
.
 As isolated RPCs share little common extracellular influences, this suggests
 that the regulation for the proliferation and differentiation of progenitors
 are intrinsic.
 However, at the same time, individual clones derived from RPCs are enormous
 heterogeneous in size and composition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Turner1987"

\end_inset

.
 Just like in epithelium, we have the dual combination of individual heterogenei
ty but tissue level regulation, seemingly without cell-cell interaction.
 We are thus encouraged to seek a stochastic model of independent RPCs,
 where individual fate choice is controlled by some fixed set of probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We focus on an experiment which tracks by time-lapse microscopy cultured
 RPCs from day 20 embryos, from which detailed lineage trees may be reconstructe
d showing the exact time of divisions and fate outcomes.
 We show that even though the pattern of divisions seem very complex, there
 is a simple stochastic model which is consistent with the data.
 This draws heavily on the work in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gomes2010"

\end_inset

; experimental work was carried out by FLAFG, manuscript was written by
 MC, analysis by GZ and BDS, with discussions with WAH, FC and JAC.
 In what follows we will elide the exact experimental procedures, and refer
 the reader to the published work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To study retinal lineages, we cultured E20 rat RPCs at clonal density and
 recorded their development over time using long-term time-lapse microscopy.
 Over a period of more than 2 years, we followed the fate of 2347 RPCs.
 Of these, 856 were excluded from further analysis because the RPC either
 died (6.3%), moved away from the field of view (2.7%), touched another cell
 that was not part of the clone (6.5%), or immediately differentiated without
 dividing (21%).
 As a result, we recovered a total of 1491 RPCs that divided at least once
 to generate clones containing two cells or more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the 1491 RPCs, 1211 were recorded to have undergone a terminal division
 that generated two differentiating daughters, but were not further analysed
 in terms of cell type composition.
 Of the remaining 280 RPCs that divided more than once, the lineage trees
 of 129 could be reconstructed (all reconstructed lineages leading to clones
 of three or more cells are shown in figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and

), whereas the remaining clones had cells that were lost during the fixation
 and immunostaining process, or the outcome of at least one mitosis could
 not be resolved, most often owing to cells moving on top of each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the successfully reconstructed lineages, there were 465 differentiated
 cells, three of which had an unidentified fate (0.6%), and in the remaining
 cells we found 341 photoreptors (RPh, 73.8%), 59 bipolar cells (Bi, 12.8%),
 49 amacrine cells, (Am, 10.6%) and 13 Müller cells (Mu, 2.8%).
 These proportions are similar to those obtained after labelling RPCs at
 postnatal day (P) 0 with retroviral vectors in the mouse retina 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Turner1990"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that the reconstructed lineages vary widely in size and composition,
 and there is no clear order in which cell types are generated.
 In particular, almost all orderings of cell types occur, suggesting that
 the order of retinal cell type production is not strictly encoded in each
 lineage, at least not from E20 onwards in culture.

\begin_layout Section
Stochastic progenitors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the reconstructed lineage data, we first asked how E20 RPCs achieve
 the required balance between proliferation and differentiation.
 We analysed the different modes of cell division observed in the overall
 population.
 For the ensemble of clones with three or more cells, for which the lineage
 trees were fully reconstructed, the first division must inevitably involve
 the survival of at least one progenitor.
 Therefore, to obtain an unbiased statistical measure of the modes of cell
 division, we examined the lineage trees of the clones with three or more
 cells after their first division.
 Out of 199 divisions recorded, 44 (22.1%) were self- renewing divisions
 that produced an RPC and a differentiating daughter (P/D divisions), whereas
 144 (72.4%) were terminal, giving rise to two differentiating daughter cells
 (D/D divisions).
 Such terminal divisions, although symmetric in the sense that both daughters
 exit the cell cycle, could also be symmetric or asymmetric in the sense
 that the daughter cells may be of the same or different types, respectively.
 To avoid confusion, we shall generally refer to all terminal divisions
 as D/D divisions, regardless of whether the two daughter cells adopt the
 same or different fates.
 Finally, only 11 divisions (5.5%) were found to generate two RPCs (P/P divisions
).
 Since the P/P mode of division accounts for only a small fraction, these
 results indicate that differentiative (D/D) divisions, and to a lesser
 extent self-renewing (P/D) divisions, are the major source of neurogenesis
 and gliogenesis in the perinatal retina, at least in culture.
 Although these numbers point unambiguously to the predominance of D/D and
 P/D divisions at this stage of retinogenesis, they leave open the question
 of whether the balance of these division modes changes significantly over
 the timecourse of the experiment.
 To investigate this, we compared the second divisions of each lineage tree
 with those of the third and beyond.
 Of the 131 second divisions, 95 were D/D (72.5±7.4%), 31 were P/D (23.6±4.3%)
 and five were P/P (3.8±1.7%); errors are estimates based on Poisson statistics
 for the counts, i.e.
 (count±count)/total counts.
 This leaves 68 third and beyond divisions, of which 49 were D/D (72.1±10.3%),
 13 were P/D (19.1±5.3%) and six were P/P (8.7±3.6%).
 The difference between the second and third divisions remains within the
 error bars, indicating that over the timecourse of the experiment the ratio
 of D/D, P/D and P/P divisions remains roughly constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The similarity in the relative division ratios between one generation and
 the next suggests that the balance between proliferation and differentiation
 of a RPC is not influenced by the fate of its parent.
 In other words, the division mode of a given RPC (P/P, P/D or D/D) is unpredict
able and, in this sense, stochastic.
 To test this possibility directly, we compared the chance of finding a
 clone of size

 Strikingly, the results of a Monte Carlo simulation show an excellent agreement
 with the experimental data.
 Moreover, for the same number of clones with three or more cells (129),
 the model predicts an approximately normal distribution for the total number
 of cells across all clones, with an average of 487 and a standard deviation
 of 22.
 This is again consistent with the 465 observed in the experiment.

The observed clone size distribution is reproduced by a stochastic model.
 The data points (blue) show the size distribution associated with the 129
 clones with three or more cells.
 If we assume that the balance between proliferation and differentiation
 is determined stochastically, with RPCs dividing with a fixed probability
\begin_inset Formula $P_{PP}=0.055$
\end_inset

 of adopting the P/P cell fate, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{PD}=0.221$
\end_inset

 of adopting the P/D cell fate and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{DD}=0.724$
\end_inset

 of adopting D/D cell fate, we obtain the clone size distribution given
 by the red curve.
 The error bars on the theoretical curve denote 95% confidence intervals
 and are a result of the finite sample size.
 Since the probability of adopting the P/P cell fate is small, the size
 distribution is close to exponential, reflecting the fact that the majority
 of clones can be described by a sequence of asymmetric P/D divisions terminatin
g in a D/D division.

Independence of division and fate choice

We next considered whether the time that an RPC spends in the cell cycle
 correlates with cell fate choice.
 We directly measured the cell cycle time of RPCs generating all observed
 combinations of daughter cell pairs by counting the elapsed time between
 the mitosis that produced these cell pairs and the previous one.
 We found no significant difference in cell cycle time of divisions producing
 any of the combinations observed (

Grouping the data from all cell divisions, independent of fate, we found
 that the cell cycle time was variable within the RPC population, with an
 average of 56.0 hours and a population standard deviation of 18.9 hours.
 The distribution of cell cycles were well approximated by a log-normal
 distribution (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, right).
 Also, upon comparing the cell cycle times of any consecutive divisions
 (
\begin_inset Formula $n=61$
\end_inset

), we found no evidence of correlation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:rat-cycle-correlations"

 However, when we measured the difference in cell cycle times of all the
 daughter cells of P/P divisions (n=21), we found a standard deviation of
 17 hours, significantly smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}\times19$
\end_inset

 hours, where 19 hours is the standard deviation of all cell cycle times,
 which would be expected if their division times were uncorrelated.
 This result suggests a degree of synchrony in the timing of division of
 sister RPCs that might contribute to the general timing of retinogenesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results suggested that RPCs do not depend on mechanisms that count
 cell cycle time or the number of divisions to regulate lineage termination.
 By refining the stochastic model associated with the modes of division
 to include a log-normal spectrum of division times (consistent with the
 experimental data), a Monte Carlo simulation shows lineage termination
 times that agree with the overall distribution of termination times obtained
 experimentally (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:rat-cycle-correlations"

\end_inset

, right).
 Together, these results indicate that the timing of lineage termination,
 and thus the overall size of the retina, may be explained simply as the
 result of a combination of stochastic fate decisions.

Almost stochastic cell fate specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous experiments have shown that rod photoreceptors represent 73% of
 all cells in the mouse retina in vivo (Young, 1985), and, similarly, 73.8%
 of all cells produced in the reconstructed lineages were RPh.
 How is such an imbalance of cell type production achieved? It could be
 that multipotent RPCs are largely biased toward producing photoreceptor
 cells at each division.
 Alternatively, it could be that a subset of RPCs becomes committed at some
 point in their lineage to generate exclusively RPh cells, thereby greatly
 increasing the number of RPh cells that can be produced from the same RPC
 pool size.
 Although differences may exist between in vivo and in vitro lineage progression
, the continuous observation of RPC lineages performed in this study allowed
 us to begin to address this problem directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To benchmark the experimental data, we used a model in which both the balance
 between proliferation and differentiation, and the differentiated cell
 type, were chosen at random, with probabilities fixed by the measured average
 of each cell type produced in the clones (i.e.
 the probability that a differentiated cell adopts an RPh fate is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{RPh}=0.738$
\end_inset

, etc.), independent of the fate of its sister, parent or any other cell
 in its lineage.
 Then, to seek evidence for lineage specification, we looked for the simplest
 statistical measure focusing on the correlation of cell fate between consecutiv
e generations of cells.
 Specifically, we explored the correlation between the fates of two consecutive
 lineage-related divisions.
 From a total of 201 qualifying divisions from within the 129 clones, the
 number that generated a given cell fate versus the fate of the sister of
 the parent cell is shown in

Each entry displays three quantities for a given triplet of cells generated
 by two consecutive lineage-related divisions.
 The number in a large font denotes the observed frequency of the event.
 The superscript represents the prediction made by a stochastic model in
 which the relative division probabilities leading to proliferation and
 differentiation are set by the parameters shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{Mu}=0.028$

 The subscript indicates the quality of the agreement between the experiment
 and the stochastic model, expressed as the number of experiments (each
 involving 201 aunt/niece triplets) one would expect to perform before seeing
 a statistical fluctuation of this magnitude or greater.
 This figure should be compared with the total number of entries (75) –
 much greater than this is a sign of a genuine outlier.
 Outliers that stand at three and four standard deviations are light and
 dark red, respectively.
 For example, the entry at (RPh, RPCRPh) represents events involving two
 consecutive P/D divisions in which both differentiated progeny adopted
 the RPh cell fate.
 Out of the 201 entries, from the table, we find that such an event occurred
 24 times.
 This compares well to the 19.4 average predicted by the stochastic model.
 From the subscripted number, we see that one would expect to see a departure
 from the theoretical prediction of this magnitude or larger in one out
 of four experiments owing to statistical fluctuations, i.e.
 the observed data are entirely compatible with the statistical model.
 By contrast, if we look at the entry (Bi, AmBi), we expect to see an average
 of 0.4 events out of 201, whereas the data show six.
 Such a fluctuation would arise in typically only one out of 4.6 million
 experiments, i.e.
 the observed data are clearly incompatible with the statistical model as
 defined.

From the raw experimental data several features emerged.
 First, there were a number of entries for which no examples were found.
 Second, several of the entries were large, including the putative RPh lineage
 (RPh, RPhRPh) and (RPh, RPCRPh).
 However, by themselves, neither of these observations provides conclusive
 evidence for recurring lineage patterns.
 Since the data were acquired from only a limited number of clones, if certain
 lineage combinations were rare we might indeed expect to record no examples
 in the limited data set.
 Moreover, if cell fate choice were stochastic, but heavily biased toward
 RPh fate, we might find large entries in a seemingly RPh-specific lineage
 that derived simply by chance and not from early lineage commitment.
 Thus, to calibrate the data we used the stochastic model as a benchmark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Table 2, we also show the expected number of entries for an experiment
 with the same number, 201, of qualifying cell divisions if cell fate outcome
 were random.
 In addition, we have included the number of experiments (each with 201
 qualifying cell divisions) that we would expect to have to perform to find
 at least one experiment with a statistical fluctuation that was equal to,
 or larger than, the actual measured experimental value.
 If this number is greatly in excess of the 75 possible fate outcomes in
 the table, we can consider the entry as an outlier, seemingly inconsistent
 with the random hypothesis.
 If, by contrast, it lies within 75, any departure of the experimental value
 from the expected result can be explained simply as a fluctuation associated
 with small-number statistics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this analysis, we noticed, for example, that the large entry for (RPh,
 RPCRPh) lies well within the expected range for the random model, along
 with the vast majority of other entries, consistent with such combinations
 being produced stochastically.
 However, from the 75 entries, five outliers were identified, which stand
 at three or more standard deviations from the expected average: (RPC, RPCRPC);
 (RPh, AmAm); (RPC, AmBi); (RPC, BiMu); and (Bi, AmBi).
 Such outliers should appear at most only once per 370 entries.
 Moreover, the (Bi, AmBi) entry lies beyond five standard deviations and
 indeed would only be expected to appear around once in 4.6 million experiments.
 Clearly, these cannot be explained simply as a number fluctuation, and
 although the chronology of cell type production might somewhat influence
 lineage selection, these results suggest that, in addition to stochastic
 mechanisms, specific recurring lineages or lineage priming may play a part
 in retinogenesis.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We studied late stage rat retinal progenitors in culture, by reconstructing
 complete lineage trees from time-lapsed imaging.
 Because these progenitors recapitulate the same proportions of terminally
 differentiated neuron types as live systems, we are led to a model of the
 neurons as independent cells, stochastically choosing their fates.
 We find that the probabilities to renew versus differentiation is independent
 of time or generation, consistent with a model where the behaviour of progenito
rs do not change; however, this is based on only two generations, and fairly
 small samples, and we cannot categorically rule out the possibility that
 the probabilities actually evolve through this stage of development.
 Using this as a null hypothesis, we observed two decisive deviations from
 the predictions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There exists a strong correlation between the cell cycles of sister RPCs.
 Whilst in the current sample there are sufficiently few occurrences of
 PP divisions such that this deviation does not manifest strongly in the
 gross statistics such as clone size distributions or termination times
 across the entire sample, one might expect this effect to be significant
 during real development.
 Since there is no correlation between mother-daughter pairs, it cannot
 be due to some persistent internal biochemical state; this also rules out
 the possibility that there is some external factor which might vary between
 different physical locations in the culture, and influences the cell cycle
 length.
 The only remaining possibility is that daughter cells are somehow in a
 more similar internal state than two arbitrary progenitors, perhaps due
 to an equal sharing of the available molecular machinery from pre-mitosis,
 and that this similarity persists on the order of a cell cycle length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some stereotypic lineage combinations occur at a much higher frequency than
 expected.
 In other words, some progenitors are biased towards a certain pattern of
 fate outcome.
 Due to the small sample sizes, it would be difficult to draw significant
 conclusions about what exactly are the deviations --- it is within the
 realm of possibility that some of these deviations did arise by chance,
 especially since the expected number was so close to zero e.g.
 although the two occurrences of (RPC, BiMu) is statistically significant,
 it is very much borderline, and boosted by the innate discrete nature of
 counting; at the same time, it is possible that the statistical insignificance
 of (RPh, 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times$
\end_inset

RPh) triples will become significant if enough clones are collected.
 Nevertheless, we outline here some possibilities of interpretation.
 Although not the most statistically significant, the most important is
 the excess frequency of continued renewal (RPC, 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times$
\end_inset

RPC), which would imply that a individual lineages could be biased towards
 (or away from) renewal, implying non-independence of lineage-related progenitor
s.
 The lack of other signatures of non-independence prompts us to look for
 other explanations.
 One possibility is that there is in fact variation of fate choice probabilities
 with time, and some progenitors were harvested with a slightly earlier
 internal clock, which is biases them towards renewal.
 Another possibility is that there is some cell-extrinsic chemical factors
 which biases the cells, and it is the physical proximity of related cells
 which cause the correlated fate choice.
 The other significant excesses are concentrated in lineages with only amacrine
 and bipolar cells.
 A possible interpretation of these significant excesses, along with the
 not statistically significant excess of photoreceptor-only lineages, such
 as (RPh, 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times$
\end_inset

RPh), is that they are evidence of histogenesis, where certain cell types
 are predominately generated at specific points of development.
 It is known that in the full developmental history of retinal progenitors,
 ganglial cells are generated earlier, and indeed in this experiment on
 late-stage progenitors we see no production of ganglia at all; thus there
 is already some histogenesis occuring, at least differentiating between
 ganglia and neurons.
 Here, we see almost all possible temporal combinations of cell types within
 single lineages, so it is not the case that such ordering is strict, but
 is is possible that they are biased stochastically, as a set of evolving
 probabilities.
 This lends slight circumstantial evidence that the choice for renewal may
 also be time-evolving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current experiment is limited by its size, use of culture, and inherent
 consideration of only one particular stage of retinal development.
 Nevertheless, we believe that it supports a model of stochastic fate choice,
 and in particular where the choice for renewal is decoupled from the choice
 of which cell type to differentiate into.
 Deviations from this are explainable as a result of histogenesis, where
 the specific probabilities of different fate outcomes evolve with time.

\begin_layout Chapter
How Stochastic Progenitors Build an Invariant Zebrafish Retina
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last chapter, we saw that late stage rat retinal progenitor cells
 (RPCs) in culture can be modelled by a simple stochastic process of independent
 and time-invariant progenitors with fixed proportions for fate outcomes.
 Such a model forms a viable 
\emph on
null hypothesis
\emph default
 against which statistically significant deviations can suggest further
 scrutiny.
 We identified two particular deviations: correlations in cell cycle length
 between sister progenitor cells, and deviations in fate choice from a perfectly
 time-invariant and equipotent population of progenitors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to further dissect the origins of these observations, we turn to
 
\emph on
in vitro
\emph default
 systems of zebrafish embryos.
 In particular, because the developing retina is small, it remains sufficiently
 transparent that it is possible to image the entirety of it, including
 any labelled clones, and track them through the development process.

 The fully developed retina has distinct layers of cell types (

 the daughters will move basally to settle into the correct layer.
 Over a short period of time (20--72 hpf) the retina grows by a factor of
 approximately 12 in cell number, by both expansion in volume and increase
 in density of cells.

From previous works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Hu1999,Neumann2000"

, it is known that a wave of differentiation progresses from central to
 peripheral and nasal to temporal around the retina.
 Given the asymmetry observed early (24 hpf) in the retina (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-retina-anatomy"

 that proceeds the differentiation.
 To dissect this behaviour, we used a transgenic fish which labels proliferating
 RPCs with destabilized Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to literally visualise
 the proliferation wave (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-fucci"

).
 Counting the exact number of GFP-labelled cells in each half of sagittal
 sections, we see that the behaviour of different locations only differ
 by their relative timing, whilst recapitulating (broadly) the same raise
 and fall of labelled cells.
 In particular, note that before the raise (understood to be the proliferation
 wave) the number of labelled cells is constant, implying that the progenitors
 are in a state of quiescence.
 This is consistent with previous results showing that between 15--24 hpf
 RPCs have extremely slow cell cycle times of about 40 hr on average

We thus have a picture of progenitors which are primed for action, waiting
 for a signal.
 Upon receiving that signal, they rapidly divide leading to a rise in number
 of progenitors.
 They then equally rapidly differentiate leading to a decrease in the GPF-label.
 The wave takes approximately 16 hours to progress from the central-most
 nasal side to the outermost temporal side, after which the only remaining
 progenitors reside in the CMZ.

 In particular, heat shock (usually performed at 8 hpf) gives rise (with

 We thus have a choice of both induction time and also imaging time.

First, we note that there is a significant lack of odd sized clones from
 progenitors induced at 24 hpf and imaged at 48 hpf.
 This requires divisions in this time window to be predominantly symmetric
 renewal (PP) and sister RPCs should be synchronised --- a feature we had
 already seen in the cultured rat retinal progenitors; there it was not
 a particularly significant feature as PP divisions were rare.
 However, the lack of scarcity of 6-cell clones indicate that divisions
 are not synchronised beyond immediate sisters.
 Second, we see that this is no longer true of clones spanning 24 to 72
 hpf --- indicating asymmetric PD divisions becoming important.
 But if we look at the 48 to 72 hpf clones, we see that almost all divisions
 are terminal (DD), and furthermore with 4-cell clones greatly outnumbering
 3-cell clones, there is almost no PD either.
 Thus we conclude there being at least three separate phases: initially
 highly proliferative, composed of synchronised PP divisions, followed by
 a phase with significant PD divisions, finally almost entirely DD.
 Given such a complex and particular sequence, it is reasonable to ask if
 the progenitors are in fact stochastic at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rule out the possibility that progenitors are pre-programmed at an early
 time (<20 hpf), but rather independently decide their fate, we study a
 slightly subtle aspect of the clone distribution.
 In particular, recall that our induction method actually creates clonally
 related green cells at an early time (and upon selection is this restricted
 to those of one or two cells in the retina at 20 hpf), but the subsequent
 photoconversion only affects one of that clone and turns it red.
 We thus look at the relation between the number of red cells at 72 hpf
 and the number of green cells at 32 hpf (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-clone-dists"

\end_inset

, right).
 We note that the average number of red cells falls as the inverse of the
 number of green cells, indicating that the RPCs index their behaviour by
 a lineage-internal measure rather than a tissue-wide signal.
 Furthermore, there is considerable variance --- if the size of a clone
 is pre-programmed, then there would be almost no variance, as later progenitors
 would know if they belonged to a small or large clone.
 Thus, we see that progenitors are still stochastic, but with evolving probabili
ties for choosing their fate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we will suppose that RPCs form a functionally equivalent, equipotent
 cell population with evolving proliferative potential, which is decoupled
 from the particular specification of individual cell types.
 Through temporal and spatial correlations, we expect to capture many aspects
 of the data, including correlations that might otherwise require a causative
 hypothesis.
 Any residual correlations between lineage and clone size are therefore
 a reflection of the histogenesis of cell types or a signature of early
 fate specification.
 In this paradigm, RPCs follow a (stochastic) developmental program, passing
 from a near-quiescent phase to an active proliferating phase and finally
 to a differentiating phase.
 The initiation and timing of this developmental program is defined by the
 wave of proliferation that sweeps around the retina, starting at the central
 nasal region and terminating at the peripheral temporal zone.
 In the following, we will use the timing of the first mitosis to define
 the start of the development program within each lineage.
 This occurs at around 23 hpf in the central nasal region, reaching the
 peripheral temporal region around 16 hours later.
 For simplicity, we therefore suppose that RPCs enter their active phase
 at a uniform rate, expecting that deviations from this will be beyond the
 resolution of the data.
 If we assume that, over the period from 24 to 48 hpf, RPCs are limited
 to the proliferative phase, measurements of the average clone size over
 this period suggest a cell cycle time of ca.
 6 hr, allowing approximately two rounds of symmetrical cell division.
 (Anticipating the results of the live-imaging study, our simulations are
 actually performed with a shifted gamma distribution, with a refractory
 period of 4 hr, mean of 6 hr, and width of 1 hr.) In addition, the lack
 of odd-sized clones requires a high degree of synchrony between division
 times of sister progenitors; we assume a difference between sister cell
 cycles of around 1 hr, normally distributed.
 Moreover, since the average clone size grows 12- to 13-fold over the period
 from 24 hpf to 72 hpf, we can deduce that each progenitor at 48 hpf must
 go on to produce, on average, three postmitotic cells.
 Thus, we may visualize a ‘‘typical’’ clone to consist of two rounds of
 symmetrical (PP-type) division, one round of asymmetrical (PD-type) division,
 and one round of terminal (DD-type) division leading to the average 12-fold
 increase in average clone size over the time course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the variability in size of clones at 72 hpf, induced at 24 hpf,
 provides a strong signature of stochasticity in cell fate choice.
 We therefore suppose that, within a lineage, the balance between proliferation
 and differentiation is achieved through stochastic fate decisions, with
 probabilities that vary through the developmental stages (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-model"

\end_inset

).
 For simplicity, we assume these changes to occur instantaneously, thus
 avoiding having to parametrise the change beyond just a single time.
 In particular, since clones induced at 48 hpf involve very few three-cell
 clones, PD divisions must be suppressed at these later times.
 Thus, there must be at least two such changes, to start and then stop PD
 divisions; we assume that there are only these two.
 Indeed, the proportion of four-cell to two-cell clones suggests that one
 in five cell divisions involves symmetrical self-renewal, while the remaining
 four divisions are terminal.

Thus, to fully define the model, we only have to specify two time points
 to delineate the intermediate PD phase and the probabilities within that
 phase.
 The times were chosen to be 8 hr and 15 hr after the first mitosis, which
 essentially straddle the subsequent bursts of mitoses; it was found that
 the outcome was not particularly sensitive to the precise timing in any
 case, as long as they did not significantly reassign mitosis to be in different
 phases.
 The proportion of PP divisions was chosen, for simplicity again, to be
 the same as the terminal phase, i.e., one in five.
 The final parameter, the probability for PD divisions, was chosen to give
 the correct average size of 72 hpf clones induced at 24 hpf, which corresponded
 to two in five divisions.
 The proportion of DD is thus two in five during this intermediate phase.This
 model was implemented as a custom-written Monte Carlo simulation, which
 outputs probabilities for observing clones of different sizes.
 While a comparison of the measured clone size distribution to the model
 reveals a favourable fit to the experimental data (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

In limited cases, by time lapse imaging, it is possible to reconstruct the

 Amazingly, almost all the features deduced from clonal can be observed,
 such as PP divisions following PD divisions, and the near synchronous sister
 divisions

 An unexpected feature is a variation of cell cycle length depending on
 fate outcome; in particular, PP and PD divisions are narrowly distributed
 around a similar average of 7.5 ± 1.3 hr, but terminal DD-type divisions
 have cell cycle times of 12.1 ± 1.0 hr.

The reconstructed lineage trees also offer an unprecedented view on how
 histogenesis occurs, i.e.
 how some cell types are born before others.
 At the population level, there is overlap leading to several cells types
 being generated at the same time 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-synchrony-and-histogenisis"

\end_inset

.
 We seek here to distinguish between simple overlap of strictly defined
 ordering within each lineage, and where ordering is loosely defined within
 individual lineage trees.
 We find that in DD divisions, almost all possible pairs of cell types occur
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-lineage-trees"

\end_inset

.
 This eliminates the possibility of stereotypical succession of cell types,
 however, it does not satisfactorily explain the observed histogenesis.
 To attempt an answer, we performed a qualitative analysis of the available
 data, by trying to compare the clone composition of sister RPCs.
 In particular, we compress each subclone from a tree into a string (represented
 graphically as a bitmap in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-barcode"

\end_inset

, left) and compare strings by a standard Levenshtein distance measure (which
 counts the number of single-character edits that would be necessary to
 turn one string into another).
 Finally, we use a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm to sort the
 strings according to their similarity.
 It was important to compare not only the final cell types generated by
 each lineage but also the structure and order in which the cells appear.
 To do this, we chose a particular representation of trees as strings in
 order to preserve the tree structure.
 Specifically, we embedded each tree into a complete tree of sufficient
 depth, then performed a depth-first traversal to gather the cell types
 into a string (

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, we continue the themes and ideas from the previous chapter.
 In particular, we implemented and validated an 
\emph on
in vivo
\emph default
 clonal labelling system which captures retinal development in zebrafish.
 This allowed unprecedented detail of visualising the development on a clonal
 resolution, through both cohort sampling and live imaging of individual
 clones.
 Relative to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:rat-retina"

\end_inset

, we could observe the spatial as well as temporal behaviour of progenitors,
 and identified a wave which sweeps through the early retina and initiates
 proliferation of progenitors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also refined our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

null hypothesis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of independent progenitors, through accounting for the proliferation wave
 and introducing time-dependent (but a priori fixed) relative probabilities
 for fate choice.
 We found that this simple hypothesis is in agreement with the observed
 clonal size evolution and pattern of fate choice in live imaged clones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the live imaging, it was also possible to study the pattern of eventual
 cell types within individual clones and their histogenesis.
 However, the relative lack of data precluded further refinement of the
 model as it would introduce a large number of parameters to adjust, diluting
 the power of the model.
 Indeed, relative to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:rat-retina"

\end_inset

, we could not image enough clones to re-do the analysis of fate choice
 triplets and look for any statistically significant deviations from a purely
 random process.
 Nevertheless, the data does show very clear signs of a progression of cell
 types, yet individual clones did not exhibit any definite ordering in cell
 type choice.
 It seems plausible that a set of evolving probabilities for cell type choice
 is sufficient to explain the observations, but it would take a much larger
 sample size to make any significant statements to that effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A significant deviation from the simple story of independent progenitors,
 which was noted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:rat-retina"

\end_inset

, is the large correlation between the cell cycle times of sister progenitor
 cells.
 At the same time, a lack of clear correlation between unrelated cells in
 the same physical vicinity strongly suggests that the source of synchrony
 is internal, and due to sister cells somehow being in almost the same microscop
ic state upon division.
 It is unclear what other effects this extra similarity entails, since we
 did not see correlation in fate choice or terminal cell types.
 It does raise the possibility that with sufficient statistics, it may be
 possible to discern fate correlation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared with the rat retina, zebrafish development proceeds much faster
 --- typically an initial progenitor yields three or four generations before
 a total loss of proliferation.
 In our current model, we have three distinct phases of fate choice probabilitie
s with sharp boundaries.
 This choice of parametrising the evolving stochasticity of progenitors
 was motivated by a desire for simplicity, knowing that our data will only
 have so much resolution.
 In principle, there could be a smoother or more featureful variation with
 time.
 In a larger system such as the rat, it would be interesting to know if
 the same kind of phases exist (mostly proliferative, the strongly biased
 towards asymmetric differentiation, finally strongly differentiative),
 and if so, whether the boundaries are sharp or smooth.
 An argument may be given that a phase in the middle with a large bias towards
 asymmetry makes developmental sense, as it is more robust (a more linear
 growth is less likely to catastrophically fail than an exponential one)
 both in the total size and locally (leading to less need to move cells
 around to achieve a certain average density of cells).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We reiterate that our approach with modelling developmental systems is that
 of constructing a null hypothesis, against which observations can be judged
 to be surprising.
 As such, the most direct approach to challenging the hypothesis would be
 more data (larger sample sizes), which would be able to resolve finer features
 of the development process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A feature of the process which we have not considered in detail is the initial
 wave which signals the progenitors to begin their proliferation.
 We have only characterised the process in so far as to give a timescale
 on which we can build a model.

Appendix: Clone generation methodology and verification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To study how individual RPCs contribute to the cellular composition of the
 zebrafish central retina, we developed a lineage-tracing method using a
 variation of the MAZe strategy (Collins et al., 2010).
 In MAZe fish, a defined heat shock is used to drive a recombinase allowing
 expression of Gal4, which then activates an upstream activating sequence
 (UAS)-driven nuclear RFP, thereby genetically marking individual progenitor
 cells and their progeny (Collins et al., 2010).
 To overcome certain limitations of this method, we used MAZe to drive cytoplasm
ic Kaede, a protein that irreversibly switches from green to red fluorescence
 upon UV exposure (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-experimental-procedure"

\end_inset

, top).
 Fish from a MAZe line were crossed with fish from a UAS-Kaede line, and
 the resulting embryos were heat shocked at 8 hours post-fertilization (hpf).
 Twelve hours later (at 20 hpf), in about 5% of such embryos, we detected
 either single progenitors or clones of two cells in the retina.
 At 24, 32, and 48 hpf, single cells in the resulting clones were randomly
 selected for photoconversion from green to red fluorescence (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-experimental-procedure"

\end_inset

, middle panels).
 The red fluorescence proved to be durable enough for long-term live imaging
 up to 72 hpf, when the vast majority of cells in the zebrafish retina have
 left the cell cycle and differentiated into all the major neuronal and
 glial cell types (

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst detailed views on single clones are invaluable, it is essential to
 confirm that such observed clones are representative of the growth of the
 whole structure.
 Some marking protocols make preferentially label particular cell types
 or cells in particular states, or even influence cell fate through modified
 fate choice or even apoptosis.
 As an aside, the marker system used here is actually the second pass at
 such a system, the first one based around a Gal4 driver (MAZe:nlsRFP, see
 below) apparently causing cell death, and leading to a 6 month delay in
 the project.
 Sadly, it is hard to confirm representativeness of clones without first
 gathering sufficient numbers of them, thus even in retrospect it is unclear
 what could have been done to avoid the blind-alley.
 In this case, individual clones simply did not appear anomalous, even though
 in aggregate they differed significantly.
 In any case, here we lay out our consistency checks which aim to show that
 the MAZe:Kaede clones are indeed representative of the overall growth of
 the retina.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we need accurate measurements on the overall kinetics of the whole
 retina, in particular the number of cells over time, in particular by measuring
 the volume and cell density.
 The volume was obtained by fitting a surface to a three dimensional (3D)
 reconstruction of the retina at distinct developmental stages.
 The density was estimated from confocal sagittal sections and direct measuremen
ts of cell diameter perpendicular to the sections.
 Specifically, we assumed that cells with their centre within a perpendicular
 radius of the confocal plane (which is assumed to be of zero depth) will
 show up in the section, leading to a viable 3D volume as the denominator.
 These results revealed that the embryonic retina consists of approximately
 1,800 cells at 24 hpf, rising to approximately 11,000 cells at 48 hpf,
 and 21,000 cells at 72 hpf.
 This translates to a 6- and 12-fold increase, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clones derived from single progenitors at 24 hpf, as expected, showed variabilit
y in size, both at 48 hpf and 72 hpf.
 Yet, the average increase in the size of these clones was strikingly consistent
 with the measured increase in total cell number in a normal retina (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zebra-fish-clone-verification"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, two other independent methods of clone induction, single-cell
 electroporation and transplantation (of labelled cells in one animal into
 the unlabelled retina of another), gave very similar results.
 Moreover, clones from RPCs at 24 or 32 hpf produced, when pooled, a ratio
 of cell types that was comparable to the tissue’s composition.
 These results indicate that the clones, though individually variable in
 size and fates, are quantitatively representative of the retina as a whole.

\begin_layout Chapter
Conclusions and Further Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, we have tried to demonstrate the role that quantitative
 clonal lineage tracing may play in dissecting the underlying cell kinetics,
 in both homoeostasis as well as highly non-equilibrium situations.
 In particular, we have focused on the utility of being able to use the
 information in the entire 
\emph on
distribution
\emph default
 of clone sizes, as opposed to merely the mean or variance.
 We have mostly been preoccupied with models of independent stochastic cells,
 both for their analytical tractability but also the relatively few parameters
 necessary to fit against experimental data; at the present level of experimenta
lly achievable precision, these simple models appear sufficient to form
 a basis for understanding observed behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We extended the existing paradigm in epithelial tissue with quantitative
 methods which allow precision measurements of cell cycle rate and, importantly,
 branching ratios.
 Importantly, the precision allows us to rule out certain forms of independence
 between daughter cells.
 The level of precision available is sufficient to complement accepted methods
 of biochemical staining as the primary way through which quantitative measureme
nts may be carried out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We found that a stochastic model of fate choice is capable of describing
 retinal neurons in development, both 
\emph on
in vitro
\emph default
 and in live embryos.
 In this domain, the main utility of the model is as a null hypothesis against
 which we can understand if an observed collective behaviour is the result
 of some precise regulated process or merely a statistically likely outcome
 (for example, the complex pattern of potential cell types that result from
 a given retinal progenitor cell).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We extended theoretical understanding of supercritical, Markov branching
 processes, specifically the link between cell cycle distributions and limit
 distributions of clone sizes.
 We find some bounds on theoretically allowed limit distributions and a
 formula for potentially computing cell cycle distributions from measured
 limited distributions.
 We also applied this to a small data set on hyper-proliferating cultured
 human cervical epithelium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differentiating between different microscopic/biochemical models is still
 beyond the reach of the present work.
 Nevertheless, we do not believe this to be a fundamental obstacle.
 Whilst observations of universal behaviour (in the sense of statistical
 mechanics) are the most reliable evidence of a model, it is the non-universal
 deviations which allow fine dissection of the underlying mechanism.
 The main obstacle seems to be one of gathering sufficient statistics for
 the non-universal behaviour to be distinguishable from noise.
 To that end, a major area of further work must be improvements in experimental
 efficiency, as well as computational efficiency in mapping observed deviations
 to concrete models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, it may be possible to say something regarding potential cell-cell
 interactions.
 Throughout this work, we focused on models where cells are statistically
 independent, apart from potential division synchrony between daughters
 where noted.
 One can imagine at least two biologically interesting ways in which this
 assumption could be violated: daughter cells begin their lives in a closer
 internal state than two arbitrary cells, which could lead to correlations
 between nearby cells (over and above simply being in similar external environme
nts), or nearby cells could actively inhibit each other via cell-cell signals.
 It is known that in two dimensions, the latter belongs properly in a different
 universality class than branching processes, but the corrections are only
 logarithmic with time, which may be too close to a constant for biologically
 accessible timescales.
 It may be more possible to instead distinguish between these possibilities
 with non-universal corrections.

However, the primary driving force behind many of the works in this thesis
 has been novel experiments, which yield new forms of data that have no
 established method of analysis.
 We want to emphasise the importance of taking the data as the primary object
 of study, rather than trying to gang-press some particular or fashionable
 method into service.
 As such, future work will likely be dominated by the need to understand
 and refine the experimental procedures which generate novel types of data.

Due to personal circumstances, there was an unusually long hiatus between
 the last work done for this thesis and its eventual submission.
 We are therefore in an unusually advantaged state to be able to review
 some of the work which has occurred 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the publication herein, and discuss a little about where the field has
 gone since.

, the group of Cédric Blanpain carried out analogous work on mouse IFE

, with genetically induced labelling, label retention studies with H2B-GFP
 and clonal studies under homoeostasis and wounding.
 They find two types of cells capable of self-renewal, which in homoeostasis
 have vastly different typical cell cycles (4--6 times per year versus once
 per week), and which can be differentially labelled via K14 and involucrin
 promoters respectively; these behaviours were quantified in exactly analogous
 methods via both clone size distributions (joint in basal and suprabasal
 counts) and label retention studies.
 Furthermore, following wounding the slow cycling population was found to
 be dominant in repair, displaying characteristic elongated clones with
 basal attcdachment several weeks post-wounding.
 Whilst strikingly similar in detail to the observations in

 slow-cycling population which mobilises for repair is totally distinct.
 It would seem that two similar tissues really can be maintained by different
 homoeostatic mechanisms, in utter defiance of Occam's razor.
 In our opinion, this sharpens the need to understand what, if any, reasons
 exist for these differences, both biochemically but also from a theoretical
 population dynamics perspective --- do these distinct patterns of renewal
 confer advantages in different kinds of wounding, typical of the anatomical
 environment? A later study

 of human oesophageal epithelium concluded that a single progenitor population
 was sufficient to explain their observations, but in the absence of totally
 controlled label retention studies, it is hard to completely rule out the
 co-existence of a population of slow cycling stem cells.

 Clonal labelling techniques

 suggest that there is an equipotent population of progenitors which undergo
 stochastic renewal and differentiation, constrained to preserving the populatio
n number by homoeostasis.
 However, because of the one-dimensional nature of the anatomical niche
 that they occupy (distributed in a ring), the scaling dynamics is different
 from oesophagus and recapitulates the expected

 growth of average clone size instead.
 However, it does also appear that there exist measurable states of the
 progenitors which influences the likelihood of division

, tied to the expression of Lgr5.
 It remains unclear to what extent the states are truly distinct, or if
 cells are constantly changing their internal states on a timescale far
 smaller than a typical cell cycle, and the observed expression levels are
 merely correlated with this internal chaotic motion.

 The square-root scaling of average clone size with time is again present,
 but the functional form of the scaling distribution is distinct due to
 the production occurring on a line rather than a circle.
