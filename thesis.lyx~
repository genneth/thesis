\begin_layout Title
Stochastic Cell Fate Choice from Lineage Tracing

Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Advances in genetic methods for lineage tracing offers a new way to observe
 and dissect cell fate choice.
 Specifically, the ability to tag and eventually observe the fate of individual
 cells allows classification beyond instantaneous expression of RNA or protein.
 We thus build stochastic models which directly predict the fate outcomes
 of progenitor cells in different tissues, and use experimental data to
 quantify the effective parameters in these models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by quantitatively studying mouse oesophageal lining, an extremely
 simple model tissue for stratified epithelia in homeoestasis.
 After establishing that there exists only one progenitor population responsible
 for maintenance, we postulate a simple model of critical branching, and
 measure the parameters of the model from lineage tracing data.
 We use this model to understand drug action and behaviour under wounding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We further develop the theory of branching processes, focusing on the behaviour
 of super-critical processes and the link between cell cycle distribution
 and asymptotic size distribution.
 We establish some novel theorems characterising legitimate asymptotic size
 distributions, and a formula to recover cell cycle distributions from such
 size distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we turn to the development of vertebrate central nervous system,
 using the retina as a proxy.
 We first look at rat retinal progenitors in vitro, establishing that a
 stochastic model of fate choice is possible.
 We then turn to zebrafish embryos, which allow live imaging throughout
 the development process.
 Although complex, we find that a simple model is nevertheless sufficient
 to explain the data, though necessarily more descriptive than quantitatively
 precise.

Stochastic Progenitors in Esophageal Epithelium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Chapter overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The esophageal lining in adult mice is composed of a stratified epithelium
 (Figure), which rapidly regenerates during adulthood to act as a protective
 lining.
 Similar to inter-follicular epidermis (IFE), it is composed of multiple
 layers of keratinocytes, sitting atop a membrane that separates it from
 the rest of the mucosa.
 As in IFE, proliferation is confined to the basal layer of cells; upon
 differentiation, the cells stratify from the basal layer, lose their nucleus
 and much cellular machinery to turn into large, flat cells which are no
 longer transcriptionally active.
 Unlike epidermis, the esophageal epithelium (EE) lacks any gross anatomical
 features such as hair follicles, instead being composed of an spatially
 and temporally homogeneous population of keratinocytes undergoing continuous
 division and loss.
 It is thus uniquely suited as a clean environment in which to dissect the
 functional behaviour of cells with regards to their fate choice, via lineage
 tracing by inducible genetic labelling techniques.
 Specifically, we use genetically modified mice which carry an Enhanced
 Yellow Flourescent Protein (EYFP) gene, muted by a stop-cassette; upon
 treatment with tamoxifen the gene is activated by deletion of the stop
 cassette, leading to the production of EYFP in that cell and all its progeny.
 By using a very low does of tamoxifen, it is possible to reduce the rate
 of induction such that EYFP-positive cells are widely spaced, and thus
 at some later time each cluster of EYFP-positive progeny (clonal cluster,
 or clone) can be assumed to have come from a single progenitor (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-pictures"

\end_inset

).
 It is then possible to measure by counting the distribution of clone sizes,
 both as a univariate distribution in basal cell count (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-raw"

\end_inset

), or a two-dimensionally joint distribution in basal and suprabasal cell
 counts (

\begin_layout Standard
In the work of [Clayton and Doupé], such techniques were used to show that
 the textbook [cite?] model of epithelial proliferative units supported
 by a single long-lived, asymmetrically dividing stem cell is at odds with
 the observed basal clone size distribution, and that a stochastic model
 of progenitors dividing both symmetrically and asymmetrically is capable
 of reproducing the experimental data.
 We will engage in a similar analysis, and go further by establishing a
 quantitative framework that allows precision measurement of relevant quantities
 such as rate of turnover and proportions of progenitor fate choice.
 We then use the method to analyse the action of a drug (all-
\emph on
trans
\emph default
 retinoic acid) by quantitatively describing its action on the fate outcome
 of the progenitors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of great biological significance, but relatively independent of the analysis
 of clone size distributions, is the discovery that there are no long-lived
 slow-cycling stem cells in the EE at all.
 As such, the progenitors which we analyse in detail are also capable of
 repair, by switching to a different pattern of behaviour.
 The reader interested in these issues may find a discussion in [Doupe 2012].
 This chapter draws significantly on that publication, especially the supplement
ary therein; the experimental work was performed by DPD, MPA and AR, project
 planning by PHJ, thorough discussion with AMK, and data analysis by GZ
 and BDS.
 PHJ wrote the main text of Ref [cite], but section 2.2 is the authorship
 of BDS.

To isolate and quantify the behavior of proliferating cells, we scored the
 number of basal cells in clones containing two or more cells (i.e.
 clones in which a proliferative cell was labeled at the start of the experiment
) from 3 days to one year post-induction, by confocal imaging of esophageal
 wholemounts (fig).
 Previously, it has been shown that in a similar homeostatic stratified
 squamous epithelium, interfollicular epidermis, a simple statistical characteri
zation can be used to both establish the equipotency of a self-renewing
 cell population, and elucidate the pattern of cell fate (cite 18, 19).
 In particular, if self-renewal involves the stochastic loss and replacement
 of such progenitors, clones derived from these cells will undergo a process
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neutral drift
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in which ongoing clonal loss is compensated by the expansion of adjacent
 clones.
 However complex is the underlying dynamics, such processes lead inexorably
 to the long-term scaling of the surviving clone size distribution, in which
 the chance of finding a clone with a size larger than some multiple of
 the average remains constant over time.

Cumulative clone size distribution shows convergence onto scaling behaviour
 at late times.
 The raw basal layer clone size distribution in (fig) is reproduced here
 as the cumulative clone size distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}(t)$
\end_inset

, plotted as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 divided by the average clone size for each timepoint.
 The cumulative distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}(t)$
\end_inset

 represents the probability of finding a surviving clone with a basal layer
 size larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 At times of 3 months or more post-induction, the data sets converge onto
 each other, a manifestation of long-term scaling behaviour.
 Combined with the observed homeostatic nature of the turnover, such scaling
 behaviour shows that the self-renewing progenitor cells function as a functiona
lly equivalent population.
 The black curve denotes an exponential cumulative clone size distribution;
 the long-term behaviour predicted for any strategy involving population
 asymmetric self-renewal including the model discussed here (1-2).

\begin_layout Standard
Applied to the current dataset, the convergence of the basal layer clone
 size distribution onto a scaling form (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-scaling"

\end_inset

) both confirms the functional equivalence of the self-renewing progenitor
 cell population, and shows that the balance between their proliferation
 and differentiation is achieved on a population basis, and not at the level
 of individual cell divisions, i.e., in the course of turnover, some cells
 may undergo terminal division leading to loss while others may undergo
 symmetric duplication.
 Indeed, such behavior is consistent with the observed heterogeneity in
 the clonal composition at short times, which reveals that, soon after induction
, all possible permutations of two-cell clones can be found (i.e.
 two basal cells, one basal and one suprabasal, and two suprabasal cells).
 The same degree of heterogeneity is apparent in larger clones (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-raw"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taken together, the results above suggest that, as in interfollicular epidermis,
 EE is maintained by a single cycling progenitor cell population in which
 cell division can lead to all three possible fate outcomes; two daughters
 that go on to divide, two cells that exit cycle and then stratify out of
 the basal layer, or one daughter that goes on to divide and one that differenti
ates (cite 18, 19).
 To assess the validity of this model, and to quantify the respective rates
 and probabilities, we must turn now to a more detailed analysis of the
 short-time data, prior to scaling, where signatures of the detailed dynamics
 can be elucidated.
 To prepare for this analysis, we must embed the progenitor cell dynamics
 into a parameterization that includes the stratification and loss of terminally
 differentiated cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameterizing EP dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be concrete, we will suppose that the basal layer comprises a single
 population of cycling esophageal progenitor cells (with proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

), and their differentiating progeny (with proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\rho$
\end_inset

), which remain in the basal layer without dividing until they stratify.
 If we assume that the progenitors divide with an average rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, and the differentiating cells stratify at an average rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, to achieve homeostasis, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\rho=(1-\rho)\gamma$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the rate at which differentiated cells are generated in the basal layer
 must be perfectly matched by the rate at which they stratify into the suprabasa
l cell layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further specify the model, we must also define the distribution of cell
 cycle and stratification times.
 Here, for simplicity, we will suppose that division and stratification
 are both uncorrelated between successive events leading, in both cases,
 to an exponential (Poisson) time distribution, with averages set by the
 rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 While this assumption is surely unsafe (after all, cell division must be
 accompanied by a small refractory period before further division is possible),
 any degree of synchrony in the cell cycle or stratification timings will
 be rapidly erased from the clonal record over the timecourse.
 In particular, we expect features due to potential synchrony to be lost
 within experimental error bars after ca.
 1--2 rounds of division (cite 20).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alongside the division and stratification rates, we must further specify
 the probabilities for the respective fate outcomes following division.
 Since both the labeled cell number and their composition is found to be
 conserved over the time course, any process of cell division must be consistent
 with homeostatic turnover.
 Moreover, since, through scaling, EPs are seen to function as an equipotent
 cell population, we will therefore suppose that proliferation and differentiati
on is finely balanced so that, with probability, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, EP division results in two dividing cells, with probability, 
\begin_inset Formula $1-2r$
\end_inset

, one dividing and one non-dividing basal later cell, and with probability,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, two non-dividing basal layer cells.
 Although we cannot rule out a small contribution arising from perpendicular
 cell divisions resulting in the placement of one of the daughters directly
 into the suprabasal layer, given such divisions are observed to be rare,
 the effect of such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orientationally asymmetric
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 divisions would again be impossible to resolve.
 Similarly, we will neglect apoptosis, which was found to be negligible
 in the basal layer (Fig.
 S4E).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the time-evolution of the basal layer population, along with
 the clonal fate data, is therefore fully characterized by three adjustable
 parameters, the division rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, the stratification rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, and the fraction of divisions that lead to symmetrical fate, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 The progenitor cell fraction is then fixed by the rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\gamma/(\lambda+\gamma)$
\end_inset

.
 To fully characterize the behavior of the 
\emph on
total
\emph default
 clone size, including suprabasal as well as basal cells, we must include
 a further parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, which defines the average rate at which suprabasal cells are shed from
 the tissue (once again, we will suppose for simplicity that the corresponding
 distribution of shedding times is Poisson).
 Fortunately, this additional parameter can be related directly to the division
 and stratification rates through the ratio of nucleated suprabasal to basal
 layer cells, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, which can be measured directly.
 Then, since the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flux
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of differentiated cells stratifying from the basal layer must be perfectly
 compensated by the flux of differentiated cells that are shed, we must
 have 
\begin_inset Formula $m\mu=\rho\lambda=\gamma\lambda/(\gamma+\lambda)$
\end_inset

, thereby providing a relation linking 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taken together, the EP cell model dynamics can be cast as a critical (i.e.
 balanced) continuous time Markovian branching process, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
{\rm EP}\stackrel{{\displaystyle {\lambda}}}{\longrightarrow} & \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
{\rm EP}+{\rm EP} & {\rm Pr.}\ r\\
{\rm EP}+{\rm T}_{{\rm B}} & {\rm Pr.}\ 1-2r\\
{\rm T}_{{\rm B}}+{\rm T}_{{\rm B}} & {\rm Pr.}\ r
\end{array}\right.\\
{\rm T}_{{\rm B}}\stackrel{{\displaystyle {\gamma}}}{\longrightarrow} & {\rm T}_{{\rm S}},\\
{\rm T}_{{\rm S}}\stackrel{{\displaystyle {\mu}}}{\longrightarrow} & \textrm{loss},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{EP}$
\end_inset

 represents the progenitor, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{B/S}}$
\end_inset

 differentiated cells in the basal/suprabasal layer, and the rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 are defined above.
 As discussed above, we suppose that EP cell fate follows a pattern of intrinsic
 or cell-autonomous regulation in which the fate outcome following division
 is uncorrelated with the behavior of neighboring cells.
 In previous studies, we have shown that, in the two-dimensional geometry
 pertinent to EE, the long-term clonal dynamics is largely insensitive to
 this choice (30).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This completes the specification of the cellular dynamics as a generalized
 branching-type process.
 In principle, we could further refine the modeling scheme to include aspects
 of the spatial regulation.
 However, our aim here is to establish and challenge the simplest model
 which is consistent with the observed range of clonal fate data.
 Indeed, we will find that, by itself, this model provides a faithful descriptio
n of the cellular dynamics over the timecourse of the experiment.
 To assess the integrity of the model, and to fit the three adjustable parameter
s, we will make use of a Bayesian approach.

\begin_layout Subsection
Scaling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the EP cell paradigm, following induction, a differentiated
 basal or suprabasal cell would progressively stratify, lose its cell nucleus
 and be shed, providing only a transient contribution to the clonal dynamics.
 By contrast, a clone derived from an EP cell would progressively undergo
 chance expansion or contraction according to the fate choice of the constituent
 cells.
 As tissue turns over, the gradual extinction of some clones due to chance
 commitment to terminal differentiation will be perfectly compensated by
 the expansion of other clones.
 Analysis of the branching process shows that, over time, neutral drift
 dynamics leads to a progressive (linear) increase in the average size of
 the surviving clones, while the surviving fraction falls proportionally
 such that the total density of labeled cells remains constant (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-raw"

\end_inset

, inset middle left) (18).
 In this regime, the basal layer clone size distribution acquires a scaling
 behavior (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-basal-scaling"

\end_inset

) described above.
 In particular, the chance of finding a clone with more than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 basal layer cells, takes the form of an exponential 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp[-n/\langle n(t)\rangle]$
\end_inset

 where, according to the parameters of the model, the average basal layer
 clone size (i.e.
 the average size of the clone 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

footprint
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the basal layer) is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle n(t)\rangle\simeq t/\tau$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau=\rho/r\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the long-term scaling behavior provides the means to extract the
 characteristic timescale 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 (see below), the rapid convergence to this regime does not allow the individual
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 to be inferred reliably from the basal layer clone size distribution alone.
 Therefore, to properly validate the model, and effect a reliable fit of
 the parameters, we consider the full range of clonal fate data, short-term
 and long-term, basal and suprabasal.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

.
 One might approach the fit with a least-squares method to optimize the
 parameters.
 However, as a significant portion of our data lies in the tails with large
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, where the counts are small, we would have to employ complex methods such
 as ad-hoc binning or continuity corrections.
 As such, we have elected to use a more Bayesian approach, which allows
 us to analyze the experiment with no manipulation of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fit the model to the range of experimental data, we implement a basic
 algorithm involving Bayes' theorem for updating prior probabilities in
 the presence of data.
 More precisely, the probability that the observed clonal fate data 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is described by the model is specified by the proportionality, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P\left(\lambda,r,\rho|D\right)\propto P\left(D|\lambda,r,\rho\right)P\left(\lambda,r,\rho\right),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where the posterior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P(D|\lambda,r,\rho)$
\end_inset

 denotes the probability of obtaining the data 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 given the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, multiplied by the likelihood that the parameters are given by those same
 values.
 The constant of proportionality may be calculated 
\emph on
a posteriori
\emph default
 by imposing the normalisation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{\infty}\! d\lambda\int_{0}^{1}\! d\rho\int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2}}\! dr\, P\left(\lambda,r,\rho|D\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 In our case, the posterior distributions will turn out to be approximately
 Gaussian, so we may characterize the distribution by its first two moments
 and treat them as a point estimate for the parameters, and a credible interval
 covering approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $68\%$
\end_inset

 (using one standard deviation) or 
\begin_inset Formula $95\%$
\end_inset

 (using two).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Bayes' equation above, it is apparent that we need to specify a prior
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\lambda,r,\rho\right)$
\end_inset

 and a likelihood function 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(D\middle|\lambda,r,\rho\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We chose the maximum entropy prior as we have no further cogent information,
 which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 uniform on the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 uniform on the interval

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 log-uniform.
 Crucially, since we have sufficient data, the likelihood function is sharply
 peaked and only significant on a small support, and thus the posterior
 distribution is dominated by the likelihood function, and so any reasonable
 prior (one which does not fluctuate strongly over that narrow support)
 would give quantitatively similar results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to the likelihood function, since each observed clone is independent,
 it is a multinomial distribution with a countable number of outcomes: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(D\middle|\lambda,r,\rho\right)=\prod_{t}\frac{\left[\sum_{bn}f_{bn}(t)\right]!}{\prod_{bn}\left[f_{bn}(t)!\right]}\prod_{bn}\left[p_{bn}(t)\right]^{f_{bn}(t)},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}(t)$
\end_inset

 denote the expected probabilities that a clone contains 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 basal cells and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 suprabasal cells at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 post-induction.
 In the following, we will suppress the time index 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 for notational concision where it is considered unambiguous.
 To eliminate potential ambiguities due to uncertain induction frequencies
 of the two cell types, we conditioned the data on having at least two cells,
 which removes the events where a differentiated cell is induced.
 Moreover, to focus on a defined population, we further consider only clones
 which retain at least one basal layer cell.
 Thus we consider the probabilities, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{bn}\mapsto\tilde{p}_{bn}=\begin{cases}
0 & b=0\textrm{ or }b+n<2,\\
\frac{p_{bn}}{1-p_{10}-\sum_{n}p_{0n}} & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

, we consider the more fundamental distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

 describing the (unconditioned) probability of finding a clone with 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 progenitors, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 differentiated basal layer cells and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 suprabasal cells.
 From these probabilities we can determine 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 through the relation, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}=\sum_{l+m=b}p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

.
 The probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

 obey a continuous time Markov process, with the time-evolution given by
 the Master equation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}p_{lmn} & =\lambda\left[r(l-1)p_{(l-1)mn}+(1-2r)lp_{l(m-1)n}+r(l+1)p_{(l+1)(m-2)n}-lp_{lmn}\right]\\
 & +\gamma\left[(m+1)p_{l(m+1)(n-1)}-mp_{lmn}\right]-\mu np_{lmn}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with the initial conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}=\delta_{l1}\delta_{m0}\delta_{n0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although this is a straightforward set of coupled differential equations,
 direct numerical solution is prohibitively computationally expensive because
 each element is coupled to all the others: attempts to truncate the 
\begin_inset Formula $lmn$
\end_inset

-space causes errors that are hard to control.
 Instead, to develop the computational scheme, it is helpful to package
 the equations into the form of a generating function, 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,y,z,t)=\sum_{lmn}p_{lmn}(t)x^{l}y^{m}z^{n}$
\end_inset

, which obeys the differential equation, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} & =\lambda\left[rx^{2}+(1-2r)xy+ry^{2}-x\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}+\gamma\left(z-y\right)\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+\mu(1-z)\frac{\partial G}{\partial z},\\
 & =\lambda\left[f_{x}(x,y,z)-x\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}+\gamma\left[f_{y}(x,y,z)-y\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}+\mu\left[f_{z}(x,y,z)-z\right]\frac{\partial G}{\partial z}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,y,z,t=0)=x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
f_{x}(x,y,z) & =rx^{2}+(1-2r)xy+ry^{2},\\
f_{y}(x,y,z) & =z,\\
f_{z}(x,y,z) & =1
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which can be recognised as the probability generating functions for individual
 divisions of each cell type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial differential equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 may be solved by the method of characteristics.
 Introducing the auxiliary equations, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}F_{v}(\mathbf{v},t)=a_{v}\left[f_{v}\left(F_{x},F_{y},F_{z}\right)-v\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=(x,y,z)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 ranges over the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{v}$
\end_inset

 ranges over 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\lambda,\gamma,\mu\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{v}(\mathbf{v},t=0)$
\end_inset

 ranges over 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

, we can write the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,y,z,t)=F_{x}(x,y,z,t)$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, we can recognize the auxiliary function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{v}$
\end_inset

 as the probability generating functions for the clone size distribution
 starting with a cell of type 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{lmn}$
\end_inset

 may be extracted from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 by complex analysis.
 Indeed, it is possible to directly extract 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 by considering 
\begin_inset Formula $G(x,x,z,t)$
\end_inset

.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(x,y,t)=G(x,x,y,t)=\sum_{bn}p_{bn}(t)x^{b}y^{n},
\]

\end_inset

we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is analytic in both 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 on the complex unit disc 
\begin_inset Formula $|x|,|y|\le1$
\end_inset

, and so there are no poles within it.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 to be an anticlockwise contour around the unit circle, we can recover 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 by considering residues at zero: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{bn}(t)=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^{2}\oint_{\mathcal{C}}dx\oint_{\mathcal{C}}dy\frac{H(x,y,t)}{x^{b+1}y^{n+1}}.
\]

\end_inset

Note that, up to a minus sign, it is just a multi-dimensional inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-transform.
 The integral can be approached by a sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{bn}(t)=\lim_{M\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\sum_{k=1}^{M}H\left(e^{2\pi ij/M},e^{2\pi ik/M},t\right)e^{-2\pi ijb/M}e^{-2\pi ikn/M}
\]

\end_inset

the truncation of which at finite 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 approximates the integral and is in the form of a two-dimensional discrete
 Fourier transform.
 This allows the use of industrial Fast Fourier Transforms to evaluate all
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{bn}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 being a power of two simultaneously.
 We use adaptive oversampling to estimate the error in the truncation, and
 use it to bound the errors.
 This gives a robust black box algorithm which gives point estimates and
 credible intervals for arbitrary clonal data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before finally carrying out the parameter estimation, it is important to
 confirm that the degree of inter-mouse variation is sufficiently small
 to justify collating data from different mice.
 For this purpose, we made use of the long-term scaling behaviour of the
 clone size distribution.
 Although, generically, the dynamics of the basal layer cells depends independen
tly on the three adjustable parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, in the scaling limit, the basal layer clone size depends only on the only
 on the combination, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\tau=r\lambda/\rho$
\end_inset

, a measure of the rate of progenitor cell loss and replacement.
 As a result, this parameter can be estimated with a smaller uncertainty,
 allowing it to be inferred on a mouse by mouse basis for each timepoint.
 Inferring this parameter from the basal layer clone size distribution,
 as well as the total clone size at shorter times, the comparison shown
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:oes-intermouse"

\end_inset

 reveal that, although there is some degree of inter-mouse variation, the
 amalgamation of data from different mice at the same timepoint can be justified.

With the parameters for normal and atRA treated tissue in hand, it is then
 possible to predict the outcome when atRA is applied after induction.
 In particular, if we assume that, following atRA treatment, the division
 and stratification rates immediately adjust from their normal to atRA treated
 steady-state values, we can predict the resulting clone dynamics.
 Indeed, when compared to the measured basal clone distribution, we find
 that the predictions offer a favourable fit (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 By contrast, comparison with the joint suprabasal and basal distribution
 shows significant deviations (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This departure can be easily understood as the effect of atRA treatment
 on cells which have already stratified and left the basal layer is more
 complex, and there may be some time-lag before the entire tissue changes
 to the new steady-state behavior.
 Nevertheless, these results suggests that, as far as the basal layer is
 concerned, the application of atRA treatment can be well-approximated as
 an instantaneous change of the parameters of the EP cell dynamics.

Finally, the development of the EP model relied upon the observation of
 long-term scaling behavior of the basal layer clone size distribution which
 suggested that tissue maintenance involves only a single equipotent progenitor
 cell population.
 However, by focusing on clones with a total size greater than one, we eliminate
d the potential signature of a second very slow-cycling or quiescent cell
 population.
 Although the existence of such a population in EE was ruled out by the
 H2B-GFP assay, with the predictions of the EP model, we can do back and
 question whether the dynamics of the single-cell clones are consistent
 with the ansatz of the modeling scheme.

\begin_layout Standard
Since, for times in greatly in excess of the cell stratification time,

 clones to challenge the predicted model dynamics.
 Once again, the results, shown in Fig.
 S13, reveal an excellent agreement between theory and experiment over the
 year long timecourse.
 In particular, we can conclude that the persistence of single-cell clones
 merely reflects the set of clones which, by chance, have expanded and the
 sister cells have been shed leaving behind a single labeled cell.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that there is a population of progenitors in EE which maintains
 the tissue, which is modelled by a simple stochastic branching process.
 The progenitors divide at a constant rate and chose one of three fates
 with fixed probabilities; differentiated cells stratify and eventually
 shed.
 The model contains four parameters: the EP cell division rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, the ratio of symmetric to asymmetric cell divisions controlled by the
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, the stratification rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, and the loss rate of cells from tissue 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 The latter is fixed by the ratio of basal to suprabasal cells, which may
 be accurately measured; the other three were measured from observed clone
 size distributions.
 Moreover, we have shown that this model can capture the effect of atRA
 treatment through a straightforward adjustment of the average EP cell division
 rate.

Theorems on Super-critical Branching Processes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When cancer cell lines are cultured, it is sometimes observed that all cells
 remain in cell cycle (according to biochemical markers).
 It therefore seems reasonable to model the cells as independent and identical,
 which has a natural expression in the theory of super-critical branching
 processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Athreya2004"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, as the cells proliferate rapidly, it is possible to obtain
 some fairly large amount of statistics regarding the clone size distribution.
 It is well-known that the limit distribution depends on the lifetime distributi
on of the particles, i.e.
 the cell cycle distribution.
 We therefore seek to infer the cell cycle distribution from the measurable
 clone size distribution.
 Concretely, we attempt to invert the relationship between the cell cycle
 distribution and the clone size distribution, and investigate its stability
 and (un)suitability as a practical procedure.
 Along the way we find that not all distributions can arise as the limiting
 distribution of a super-critical branching process, and we conjecture and
 prove some properties of them.

This chapter was inspired by conversations with the Jones team, who provided
 the initial data for this theoretical detour.
 It is unfortunate that ultimately the results were not sufficiently useful
 to be biologically relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The inversion formula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider an equipotent population of cells which divide independently.
 This may be modelled as a branching process, defined by specifying the
 cell cycle distribution be 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 and the branching outcomes of each division, which we package into a generating
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)=\sum_{k}p_{k}s^{k}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the probability for the cell to divide into 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 daughters.
 We will restrict ourselves to biologically feasible processes, in particular
 we will require all moments of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 to exist.
 Furthermore, we will assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, as it simplifies the consideration by avoiding total death of the clone;
 for any given 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 we can construct a 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\star}$
\end_inset

 of equal order such that no death occurs, with the only difference being
 the existence of terminal clones (see appendix
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:condition-survival"

\end_inset

).
 We also exclude certain pathological behaviours from consideration, such
 as the possibility for a clone to reach infinite size in finite time, which
 excludes in particular the existence of a Dirac delta spike at zero in
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 We consider in particular the 
\emph on
super-critical
\emph default
 process, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(1)>1$
\end_inset

 and the expected number of cells diverges exponentially at a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\left[f,g\right]$
\end_inset

 (the Malthusian parameter of the process), defined by the (only) root of
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha y}g(y)\, dy=1.
\]

\end_inset

 In the limit of infinite time, the distribution (normalised to unit mean)
 of the total number of cells converges to a distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

, whose characteristic function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(u)=\mathbb{E}\left[e^{iuW}\right]$
\end_inset

 is the unique solution (amongst distributions with unit mean) of
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi(u)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f\left[\phi\left(ue^{-\alpha y}\right)\right]g(y)\, dy.\label{eq:forwards-eq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Notice that since the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 sets a scale for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, we may remove it by scaling 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 with no change to the limiting behaviour.
 Therefore without loss of generality we shall set 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can consider equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

 as a family of non-linear transform on the space of distributions over
 the positive reals, indexed by the generating function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 It We note two properties (see appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:injective-continuity"

\end_inset

) in particular: it is continuous (in 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}$
\end_inset

-norm), and injective (for a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, up to scaling of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

).
 In particular, this implies that if we know the branching of cells (which
 for biological applications we can obtain by experiment), it is in principle
 possible to undo the transform and infer the cell cycle length from experimenta
l clone size distributions.
 However, as we will show below, this turn out to be overly optimistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In passing we note that equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

, treated as an iterative procedure, is stable and convergent.
 However, numerical implementation will have to deal with the inevitable
 deviation from the manifold of proper characteristic functions.
 In practice, we find that it is sufficient to use a cubic spline approximation
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, and clamp the boundary at the origin: 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(0)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{\prime}(0)=i$
\end_inset

.
 With an initial guess corresponding to an exponential distribution for
 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, this reliably converges to a distribution, although the mean often deviates
 from unity by a few percent.
 The convergence is fast enough to be interactive and allow numerical experiment
s, but only just.
 We show some examples in appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:forward-examples"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To invert the transformation, defining 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)=\phi\left(e^{t}\right)$
\end_inset

 we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h(t)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f\left[h\left(t-y\right)\right]g(y)\, dy,
\]

\end_inset

which is simply a convolution.
 Proceeding formally, we may take Fourier transforms and obtain the

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{\tilde{h}(\omega)}{\widetilde{f\odot h}(\omega)},\label{eq:backward-eq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\odot h$
\end_inset

 is the composition of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 followed by 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{t\rightarrow-\infty}h(t)=\phi(0)=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is not integrable.
 Furthermore, since 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

 considered as a distribution on the entire real line almost certainly has
 discontinuities in its derivatives at the origin, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(u)$
\end_inset

 will have algebraic decay for large 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

; thus 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)=O\left(e^{-ct}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, for some finite 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the Fourier transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h}$
\end_inset

 will only converge and thus be defined on the strip 
\begin_inset Formula $-c<\Im\left(\omega\right)<0$
\end_inset

 (the strip will be as least as wide for 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{f\odot h}$
\end_inset

).
 Thus for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 to be well-defined, we require that the quotient in the inversion formula
 be analytically extended to include the real line, and give a characteristic
 function on it; in addition, it must be entirely analytic in the lower
 half-plane in order for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 to be causal, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t<0$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore we are led to study what exactly is the image of the transform
 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

 (equivalently the domain of the Klein formula).
 We can show than the tail of 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

 is bounded from above by any power-law decay and from below by an exponential,
 and conjecture that it is in fact exactly exponential (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "app:moment-theorems"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Directly applying the Klein formula (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "app:examples"

\end_inset

), we can reproduce the known results for the exponential (Markovian) process,
 and the discrete time process.
 In addition, we can concretely invert the gamma distribution.
 However, more generally, although formally we can invert distributions
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)=p(W)e^{-\lambda W}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is some polynomial, generically they do not yield proper distributions
 upon inversion.
 We conjecture that in the space of distributions, at a generic point in
 the image of the forwards transforms, almost all directions (i.e.
 perturbations) lead off the manifold; but nevertheless, there is a countable
 number of perturbations which remain on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practically, for application to experimental data, the outlook is pessimistic
 for two reasons.
 One is that because the transform in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

 is continuous, there is not a sharply optimal choice for an inverse that
 optimises some cost function (likelihood, for instance).
 In particular, numerical experiments show that changes to 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 which do not significantly change extreme behaviours tends to have negligible
 effect on the outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Second is that although the transform is injective, meaning that it is
 invertible, it depends on having access to the limiting distribution.
 For interesting problems, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 having power law tails, a real experiment necessarily will fail to probe
 the tail structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More generically (and realistically), we might have multi-type processes.
 There we encounter the problem that it would be necessary to have access
 to the limit distributions starting from all the different cell types,
 which may present a complete barrier to experiments.
 It is an open question however, about whether one can approximate a multi-type
 process with a single-type process, by appropriately choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, we find that as a practical procedure, the inversion formula
 (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:backward-eq"

\end_inset

) is not practical for biological applications.
 Nevertheless, it is possible to use it to find some novel pairs of limiting
 distributions and cell cycle lengths, which would otherwise necessitate
 solving a non-linear integral equation (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the transform in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:forwards-eq"

\end_inset

 is continuous, the limit distribution will not change qualitatively for
 moderate changes to the cell cycle distribution.
 In particular, the biologically relevant example of a mono-modal distribution
 with an initial refractory period is sufficiently close to give very similar
 limit distributions.
 In any case, since the right tail is always exponential (appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:moment-theorems"

\end_inset

), the only qualitative change possible is the behaviour near the origin,
 i.e.
 increase the proportion of clones smaller than the average.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we may consider a process where the division of each cell can produce
 a large number of progeny relative to the average.
 Specifically, consider 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(s)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{s^{k}}{2^{k}}=\frac{s}{s-2}.
\]

\end_inset

 For the Markovian process it is possible 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "III.8, theorem 3"
key "Athreya2004"

\end_inset

 to analytically obtain the limit distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(W)=\frac{1}{2}\left[-1+\frac{2e^{-W/4}}{\sqrt{\pi}\sqrt{W}}+\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sqrt{W}}{2}\right)\right],
\]

\end_inset

which has a weak divergence at the origin.
 More intuitively, if we consider the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\log W$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
J(s)=H\left(e^{s}\right)e^{s} & =\frac{e^{\frac{s}{2}-\frac{e^{s}}{4}}}{\sqrt{\pi}}-\frac{1}{2}e^{s}\mathrm{erfc}\left(\frac{e^{s/2}}{2}\right)\\
 & \sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{s/2}\textrm{, }s\rightarrow-\infty,
\end{align*}

\end_inset

we see that it still decays exponentially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, we can simply have some cells which divide very slowly.
 In particular, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:g-power-limits"

\end_inset

 shows the limit distributions for binary fission with the family 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(t)=\frac{\mathrm{sinc}\left(\frac{n}{\pi}\right)}{1+\left(t-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}}\Theta\left(t-\frac{1}{2}\right),\ n\ge2.\label{eq:power-law-g}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As can be seen in the inset, the corresponding distribution in 
\begin_inset Formula $\log W$
\end_inset

 has a power-law tail for small 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

, implying a divergence 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(W)\approx\frac{C}{W\log^{n}W},\ W\rightarrow0.
\]

\end_inset

Notice however, that the local minimum in 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 becomes closer to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, and the divergence at the origin become more narrow.
 If we impose an upper-end cut-off to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

, then the divergence is removed, without significant changes to the rest
 of the curve.

\begin_inset Formula $w>w_{0}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left[W_{1}>w\right]\ge\mathbb{P}\left[W_{2}>w\right].
\]

\end_inset

To see this, consider the contrapositive, which is that if the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[W_{1}>w\right]<\mathbb{P}\left[W_{2}>w\right]$
\end_inset

 is unbounded, then for at least one 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[W_{1}^{n}\right]<\mathbb{E}\left[W_{2}^{n}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 We then check two cases: (a) if it there exist arbitrarily large 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[W_{1}>w\right]>\mathbb{P}\left[W_{2}>w\right]$
\end_inset

 then it would be a contradiction for the moments to be dominated 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, if the moments 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n}\right]\in n\log n+\Theta(n)$
\end_inset

 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 then the tail 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]$
\end_inset

 is exponential, in some sense.
 In particular, existing work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Abate1996"

\end_inset

 suggests that if the limits 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta_{n}=\frac{n\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n-1}\right]}{\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n}\right]}\rightarrow\eta
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{n}=\frac{\eta_{n}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[W^{n}\right]}{n!}\rightarrow A
\]

\end_inset

 exist, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{w\rightarrow\infty}e^{\eta w}\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]=A.
\]

\end_inset

 Finally, we consider equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:moment-recursion"

\end_inset

 and drop all terms higher than quadratic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{M_{n}}{n!}\ge\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{M_{k}M_{n-k}}{k!(n-k)!}\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}{1-f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}\label{eq:moments-lower-bound}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which follows as each term in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:moment-recursion"

\end_inset

 is positive.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(n)=M_{n}/n!$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xi(n)\ge\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\xi(k)\xi(n-k)K_{n},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
K_{n} & =\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}{1-f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy}\\
 & >\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(1)}{1-f^{\prime}(1)\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2y}g(y)\, dy}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ny}g(y)\, dy\\
 & \ge C\eta^{-n}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

for some 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 Using the equality we can convert this into a lower bound 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{n}\ge\frac{n!}{C\eta^{n}}
\]

\end_inset

which by the above gives an exponential tail.
 Thus, we conclude that the tail of a limit distribution is exponentially
 bounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of binary fission, we can improve the upper bound slightly.
 In particular, the equality in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:moments-lower-bound"

\end_inset

 applies.
 An upper bound on the moments is then given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{K_{2}M_{n}}{n!}\le\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{K_{2}M_{k}}{k!}\frac{K_{2}M_{n-k}}{(n-k)!}.
\]

\end_inset

with equality for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\le2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{2}=\frac{2\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2y}g(y)\, dy}{1-2\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2y}g(y)\, dy}.
\]

\end_inset

We obtain an upper bound in terms of the Catalan numbers
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{K_{2}M_{n}}{n!}\le\frac{K_{2}^{n}(2n-2)!}{(n-1)!n!}
\]

\end_inset

Then applying the moments bound
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Philips1995"

\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]=\inf_{n}\frac{M_{n}}{w^{n}}\le\inf_{n}\frac{K_{2}^{n-1}(2n-2)!}{(n-1)!w^{n}},
\]

\end_inset

which for large 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}\left[W>w\right]=O\left(\frac{1}{w}\right)e^{-\frac{w}{4K_{2}}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we note that removing the assumption that all moments of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 exist will remove the upper bound but not the exponential lower bound.
 Furthermore, if the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is infinite, then the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

'th moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 will be as well, suggesting a tail 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)\approx W^{-k-1}$
\end_inset

; indeed, the moment will diverge at finite times.

If

\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(u)=e^{iu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)=e^{ie^{t}}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{h}(\omega)=e^{\pi\omega/2}\Gamma\left(-i\omega\right)$
\end_inset

, defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\Im(\omega)<1$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(s)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_{k}s^{k}
\]

\end_inset

 (notice that we do not have a constant term), 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widetilde{f\odot h}(\omega)=e^{\pi\omega/2}\Gamma\left(-i\omega\right)\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_{k}k^{i\omega}
\]

\end_inset

defined on the same strip.
 The quotient is then well defined:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}p_{k}k^{i\omega}}.
\]

\end_inset

If only one 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero (and therefore equal to one), we would have a well-defined
 distribution
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\delta(t-\ln k),
\]

\end_inset

which reproduces the trivial result that a discrete time Markovian process
 with fixed outcomes in each division necessarily leads to a Dirac distribution
 as the limit.
 For a more generic 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 it does not lead to a probability distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Exponential tailed distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As conjectured, the tail of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is always exponential.
 With the integral above we can consider the very general class
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H(W)=\sum_{k}a_{k}\frac{\lambda^{k+1}}{\Gamma(k+1)}W^{k}e^{-\lambda W}
\]

\end_inset

where normalisation requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}a_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 and unity mean requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}a_{k}(k+1)/\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, though as we shall see the latter will be automatically enforced.
 The characteristic function is very helpfully just a sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi(u)=\sum_{k}a_{k}\left(1-\frac{iu}{\lambda}\right)^{-k-1}.
\]

\end_inset

Importantly, 
\begin_inset Formula $f\odot\phi$
\end_inset

 has the same structure, composed of a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-iu/\lambda)^{-n}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we only have to consider a single integral (convergent on 
\begin_inset Formula $-k-1<\Im\{\omega\}<0$
\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i\omega t}\left(1-\frac{ie^{t}}{\lambda}\right)^{-k-1}dt\\
= & \lambda^{i\omega}\int_{0}^{\infty}z^{i\omega-1}(1-iz)^{-k-1}dz\\
= & \lambda^{i\omega}e^{-\pi\omega/2}\frac{\Gamma\left(1+k-i\omega\right)\Gamma\left(i\omega\right)}{\Gamma(1+k)}\\
= & \lambda^{i\omega}e^{-\pi\omega/2}\Gamma(1-i\omega)\Gamma\left(i\omega\right)\frac{\left(1-i\omega\right)_{k}}{\Gamma(1+k)}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z\right)_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the Pochhammer symbol.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:backward-eq"

\end_inset

, upon taking the quotient all but the last factor above cancel.
 Define the auxiliary polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z)=\sum_{k}a_{k}z^{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(z)=\frac{1}{z}f\left[zP(z)\right]$
\end_inset

 and a transform on polynomials defined by being linear and acts on each
 monomial as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{z^{k}}\Longrightarrow\frac{(1+z)_{k}}{\Gamma(k+1)}.
\]

\end_inset

Then by linearity we immediately get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{\widehat{P}(-i\omega)}{\widehat{Q}(-i\omega)}.
\]

\end_inset

Notice that the formula above is completely independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

; the correct one such that 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)$
\end_inset

 has mean of unity will be chose.
 We can find 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 by applying the Heaviside formula to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}(iz)$
\end_inset

 (treating it as an inverse Laplace transform), and generically it will
 be a sum of exponentials (possibly with complex exponents, but always occurring
 in conjugate pairs), determined by the locations of zeros of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that whilst 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}(z)$
\end_inset

 cannot have any zeros on the positive real line, generically there may
 be zeros on the right half plane.
 Below, we will try and give some simple cases where this can be done and
 it yields proper cell cycle distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest case is 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)=e^{-W}$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(z)=\frac{1}{z}f(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sum_{k}p_{k}(1-i\omega)_{k-1}/\Gamma(k)}.
\]

\end_inset

If only one 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=(k-1)e^{-(k-1)t}\left(e^{t}-1\right)^{k-2}.
\]

\end_inset

In particular this reproduces the result that for binary fission (
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

) the Markovian process (
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)=e^{-t}$
\end_inset

) gives an exponential distribution in the limit.
 Biologically cells can only divide into two, so we can consider 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=(1-r)z+rz^{2}.$
\end_inset

 In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\frac{1}{r}e^{-t/r},
\]

\end_inset

 which is again Markovian, and, in hindsight obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another simple case is when 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

-distribution; in that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z)=z^{\beta-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(z)=\frac{1}{z}f\left(\beta^{\beta}z^{\beta}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\tilde{g}(\omega) & =\frac{(1-i\omega)_{\beta-1}/\Gamma(\beta)}{\sum_{k}p_{k}(1-i\omega)_{k\beta-1}/\Gamma(k\beta)}\\
 & =\left[\sum_{k}p_{k}\frac{(\beta-i\omega)_{(k-1)\beta}}{(\beta)_{(k-1)\beta}}\right]^{-1}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

If only one 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero then the poles are simple and line on the positive imaginary
 axis, and furthermore 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$
\end_inset

 is positive:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\frac{\Gamma(k\beta)}{\Gamma(\beta)\Gamma\left[(k-1)\beta\right]}e^{-(k\beta-1)t}\left(e^{t}-1\right)^{(k-1)\beta-1}.
\]

\end_inset

Note that this reproduces, in appropriate limits, the results above for
 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)=e^{-W}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H(W)=\delta(W-1)$
\end_inset

.

 In addition, for

\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\beta}e^{-\beta t}t^{\beta-1}/\Gamma(\beta)$

More generically, it becomes very difficult to find the conditions such
 that the Klein formula is well-defined.
 Consider even the restricted case that

 a generic biologically sensible branching process, starting with a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{g}\left(\omega\right)=\left[(1-r)+r\frac{\left(\beta-i\omega\right)_{\beta}}{\left(\beta\right)_{\beta}}\right]^{-1}.
\]

\end_inset

Starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=2$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\frac{6e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(5+\sqrt{25-\frac{24}{r}}\right)t}\left(-1+e^{\sqrt{25-\frac{24}{r}}t}\right)}{\sqrt{r(-24+25r)}}
\]

\end_inset

which is only positive everywhere if 
\begin_inset Formula $r>24/25$
\end_inset

, in which case all exponents are real.
 However, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=3$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g(t)=\frac{60\left[\omega_{1}\left(e^{t\omega_{2}}-e^{t\omega_{3}}\right)+\omega_{2}\left(e^{t\omega_{3}}-e^{t\omega_{1}}\right)+\omega_{3}\left(e^{t\omega_{1}}-e^{t\omega_{2}}\right)\right]}{r\left(\omega_{1}-\omega_{2}\right)\left(\omega_{2}-\omega_{3}\right)\left(\omega_{3}-\omega_{1}\right)}

\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1,2,3}$
\end_inset

 are the three roots to the cubic 
\begin_inset Formula $60+47rz+12rz^{2}+rz^{3}=0$
\end_inset

 All three roots have negative real parts for 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gtrsim0.106383$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $g(t)$

 Indeed, only for

 well-defined.
 By similar arguments, for

Stochastic Fate Choice in Cultured Rat Retinal Progenitors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Chapter Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The central question of developmental biology is how do cells organise their
 divisions to achieve the same body plan reproducibly.
 One could imagine that each cell is pre-programmed with the instructions
 (and classical lineage tracing experiments in 
\emph on
C.
 elegans
\emph default
 suggests that this does occur [cite]), or alternatively there is some complex
 emergent organisation which only manifests within the right environment
 (?? shows the importance of cell-cell interactions for spermatogenesis).
 Here we study rat retinal progenitors from day 20 
\emph on
in vitro
\emph default
; these cells are late in the developmental process, and nearing complete
 diffenentiation.
 Earlier work [Cayouette] had established that even under culture conditions
 retinal progenitors cells (RPCs) will generate the correct proportions
 of retinal cell types, even while each individual RPC generates a heterogeneous
 collection of cells; this raises the possibility that there is indeed a
 great deal of intrinsic pre-programming, but expressed as a stochastic
 procedure which averages over a population to give the correct outcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we focus on an experiment which tracks by time-lapse microscopy
 cultured RPCs, from which detailed lineage trees may be reconstructed,
 showing the exact time of divisions and fate outcomes.
 We show that even though the pattern of divisions seem very complex, there
 is a simple stochastic model which is consistent with the data.
 This draws heavily on the work in [cite]; experimental work was carried
 out by FLAFG, manuscript was written by MC, analysis by GZ and BDS, with
 discussions with WAH, FC and JAC.
 In what follows we will elide the exact experimental procedures, and refer
 the reader to the published work [cite].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To study retinal lineages, we cultured E20 rat RPCs at clonal density and
 recorded their development over time using long-term time-lapse microscopy.
 Over a period of more than 2 years, we followed the fate of 2347 RPCs.
 Of these, 856 were excluded from further analysis because the RPC either
 died (6.3%), moved away from the field of view (2.7%), touched another cell
 that was not part of the clone (6.5%), or immediately differentiated without
 dividing (21%).
 As a result, we recovered a total of 1491 RPCs that divided at least once
 to generate clones containing two cells or more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the 1491 RPCs, 1211 were recorded to have undergone a terminal division
 that generated two differentiating daughters, but were not further analyzed
 in terms of cell type composition.
 Of the remaining 280 RPCs that divided more than once, the lineage trees
 of 129 could be reconstructed (all reconstructed lineages leading to clones
 of three or more cells are shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:rat-raw"

\end_inset

), whereas the remaining clones had cells that were lost during the fixation
 and immunostaining process, or the outcome of at least one mitosis could
 not be resolved, most often owing to cells moving on top of each other.

In the successfully reconstructed lineages, there were 465 differentiated
 cells, three of which had an unidentified fate (0.6%), and in the remaining
 cells we found 341 RPh (73.8%), 59 Bi (12.8%), 49 Am (10.6%) and 13 Mu (2.8%).
 These proportions are similar to those obtained after labeling RPCs at
 postnatal day (P) 0 with retroviral vectors in the mouse retina (Turner
 et al., 1990).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that the reconstructed lineages vary widely in size and composition,
 and there is no clear order in which cell types are generated.
 In particular, almost all orderings of cell types occur, suggesting that
 the order of retinal cell type production is not strictly encoded in each
 lineage, at least not from E20 onwards in culture.

\begin_layout Section
Stochastic progenitors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the reconstructed lineage data, we first asked how E20 RPCs achieve
 the required balance between proliferation and differentiation.
 We analyzed the different modes of cell division observed in the overall
 population.
 For the ensemble of clones with three or more cells, for which the lineage
 trees were fully reconstructed, the first division must inevitably involve
 the survival of at least one progenitor.
 Therefore, to obtain an unbiased statistical measure of the modes of cell
 division, we examined the lineage trees of the clones with three or more
 cells after their first division.
 Out of 199 divisions recorded, 44 (22.1%) were self- renewing divisions
 that produced an RPC and a differentiating daughter (P/D divisions), whereas
 144 (72.4%) were terminal, giving rise to two differentiating daughter cells
 (D/D divisions).
 Such terminal divisions, although symmetric in the sense that both daughters
 exit the cell cycle, could also be symmetric or asymmetric in the sense
 that the daughter cells may be of the same or different types, respectively.
 To avoid confusion, we shall generally refer to all terminal divisions
 as D/D divisions, regardless of whether the two daughter cells adopt the
 same or different fates.
 Finally, only 11 divisions (5.5%) were found to generate two RPCs (P/P divisions
).
 Since the P/P mode of division accounts for only a small fraction, these
 results indicate that differentiative (D/D) divisions, and to a lesser
 extent self- renewing (P/D) divisions, are the major source of neurogenesis
 and gliogenesis in the perinatal retina, at least in culture.
 Although these figures point unambiguously to the predominance of D/D and
 P/D divisions at this stage of retinogenesis, they leave open the question
 of whether the balance of these division modes changes significantly over
 the timecourse of the experiment.
 To investigate this, we compared the second divisions of each lineage tree
 with those of the third and beyond.
 Of the 131 second divisions, 95 were D/D (72.5±7.4%), 31 were P/D (23.6±4.3%)
 and five were P/P (3.8±1.7%); errors are estimates based on Poisson statistics
 for the counts, i.e.
 (count±count)/total counts.
 This leaves 68 third and beyond divisions, of which 49 were D/D (72.1±10.3%),
 13 were P/D (19.1±5.3%) and six were P/P (8.7±3.6%).
 The difference between the second and third divisions remains within the
 error bars, indicating that over the timecourse of the experiment the ratio
 of D/D, P/D and P/P divisions remains roughly constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The similarity in the relative division ratios between one generation and
 the next suggests that the balance between proliferation and differentiation
 of a RPC is not influenced by the fate of its parent.
 In other words, the division mode of a given RPC (P/P, P/D or D/D) is unpredict
able and, in this sense, stochastic.
 To test this possibility directly, we compared the chance of finding a
 clone of size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in the experimental dataset with that predicted by a model in which RPCs
 divide with a fixed probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{PP}=0.055$
\end_inset

 of adopting the P/P cell fate, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{PD}=0.221$
\end_inset

 of adopting the P/D cell fate and

\end_inset

 of adopting the D/D cell fate (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:rat-clone-size"

\end_inset

).
 Strikingly, the results of a Monte Carlo simulation show an excellent agreement
 with the experimental data.
 Moreover, for the same number of clones with three or more cells (129),
 the model predicts an approximately normal distribution for the total number
 of cells across all clones, with an average of 487 and a standard deviation
 of 22.
 This is again consistent with the 465 observed in the experiment.

The observed clone size distribution is reproduced by a stochastic model.
 The data points (blue) show the size distribution associated with the 129
 clones with three or more cells.
 If we assume that the balance between proliferation and differentiation
 is determined stochastically, with RPCs dividing with a fixed probability

\end_inset

 by the red curve.
 The error bars on the theoretical curve denote 95% confidence intervals
 and are a result of the finite sample size.
 Since the probability of adopting the P/P cell fate is small, the size
 distribution is close to exponential, reflecting the fact that the majority
 of clones can be described by a sequence of asymmetric P/D divisions terminatin
g in a D/D division.

These results suggest that, at least from E20 and over the timecourse of
 the experiment in vitro, the mode of division of RPCs is stochastic with
 biased probabilities that remain approximately fixed.
 Our previous findings that the size distribution of clones that develop
 in clonal-density cultures is very similar to that of clones that develop
 
\emph on
ex vivo
\emph default
 in retinal explants (Cayouette et al., 2003) suggest that this is not a
 pathology associated with culture conditions.
 In addition, because the RPCs are cultured at clonal density, these results
 suggest that biased probabilities do not depend on specific environmental
 cues.

Independence of division and fate choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next considered whether the time that an RPC spends in the cell cycle
 correlates with cell fate choice.
 We directly measured the cell cycle time of RPCs generating all observed
 combinations of daughter cell pairs by counting the elapsed time between
 the mitosis that produced these cell pairs and the previous one.
 We found no significant difference in cell cycle time of divisions producing
 any of the combinations observed (

 cell fate decision.

\begin_layout Standard
Grouping the data from all cell divisions, independent of fate, we found
 that the cell cycle time was variable within the RPC population, with an
 average of 56.0 hours and a population standard deviation of 18.9 hours.
 The distribution of cell cycles were well approximated by a log-normal
 distribution (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:rat-cycle-fate-and-dist"

\end_inset

, right).
 Also, upon comparing the cell cycle times of any consecutive divisions
 (
\begin_inset Formula $n=61$
\end_inset

), we found no evidence of correlation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:rat-cycle-correlations"

\end_inset

, left).
 However, when we measured the difference in cell cycle times of all the
 daughter cells of P/P divisions (n=21), we found a standard deviation of
 17 hours, significantly smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}\times19$
\end_inset

 hours, where 19 hours is the standard deviation of all cell cycle times,
 which would be expected if their division times were uncorrelated.
 This result suggests a degree of synchrony in the timing of division of
 sister RPCs that might contribute to the general timing of retinogenesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results suggested that RPCs do not depend on mechanisms that count
 cell cycle time or the number of divisions to regulate lineage termination.
 By refining the stochastic model associated with the modes of division
 to include a log-normal spectrum of division times (consistent with the
 experimental data), a Monte Carlo simulation shows lineage termination
 times that agree with the overall distribution of termination times obtained
 experimentally (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:rat-cycle-correlations"

\end_inset

, right).
 Together, these results indicate that the timing of lineage termination,
 and thus the overall size of the retina, may be explained simply as the
 result of a combination of stochastic fate decisions.

Almost stochastic cell fate specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous experiments have shown that rod photoreceptors represent 73% of
 all cells in the mouse retina in vivo (Young, 1985), and, similarly, 73.8%
 of all cells produced in the reconstructed lineages were RPh.
 How is such an imbalance of cell type production achieved? It could be
 that multipotent RPCs are largely biased toward producing photoreceptor
 cells at each division.
 Alternatively, it could be that a subset of RPCs becomes committed at some
 point in their lineage to generate exclusively RPh cells, thereby greatly
 increasing the number of RPh cells that can be produced from the same RPC
 pool size.
 Although differences may exist between in vivo and in vitro lineage progression
, the continuous observation of RPC lineages performed in this study allowed
 us to begin to address this problem directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To benchmark the experimental data, we used a model in which both the balance
 between proliferation and differentiation, and the differentiated cell
 type, were chosen at random, with probabilities fixed by the measured average
 of each cell type produced in the clones (i.e.
 the probability that a differentiated cell adopts an RPh fate is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{RPh}=0.738$
\end_inset

, etc.), independent of the fate of its sister, parent or any other cell
 in its lineage.
 Then, to seek evidence for lineage specification, we looked for the simplest
 statistical measure focusing on the correlation of cell fate between consecutiv
e generations of cells.
 Specifically, we explored the correlation between the fates of two consecutive
 lineage-related divisions.
 From a total of 201 qualifying divisions from within the 129 clones, the
 number that generated a given cell fate versus the fate of the sister of
 the parent cell is shown in

Each entry displays three quantities for a given triplet of cells generated
 by two consecutive lineage-related divisions.
 The number in a large font denotes the observed frequency of the event.
 The superscript represents the prediction made by a stochastic model in
 which the relative division probabilities leading to proliferation and
 differentiation are set by the parameters shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{Mu}=0.028$
\end_inset

, corresponding to the observed frequencies of the population.
 The subscript indicates the quality of the agreement between the experiment
 and the stochastic model, expressed as the number of experiments (each
 involving 201 aunt/niece triplets) one would expect to perform before seeing
 a statistical fluctuation of this magnitude or greater.
 This figure should be compared with the total number of entries (75) –
 much greater than this is a sign of a genuine outlier.
 Outliers that stand at three and four standard deviations are light and
 dark red, respectively.
 For example, the entry at (RPh, RPCRPh) represents events involving two
 consecutive P/D divisions in which both differentiated progeny adopted
 the RPh cell fate.
 Out of the 201 entries, from the table, we find that such an event occurred
 24 times.
 This compares to the 19.4 average predicted by the stochastic model.
 From the subscripted number, we see that one would expect to see a departure
 from the theoretical prediction of this magnitude or larger in one out
 of four experiments owing to statistical fluctuations, i.e.
 the observed data are entirely compatible with the statistical model.
 By contrast, if we look at the entry (Bi, AmBi), we expect to see an average
 of 0.4 events out of 201, whereas the data show six.
 Such a fluctuation would arise in typically only one out of 4.6 million
 experiments, i.e.
 the observed data are clearly incompatible with the statistical model as
 defined.

From the raw experimental data several features emerged.
 First, there were a number of entries for which no examples were found.
 Second, several of the entries were large, including the putative RPh lineage
 (RPh, RPhRPh) and (RPh, RPCRPh).
 However, by themselves, neither of these observations provides conclusive
 evidence for recurring lineage patterns.
 Since the data were acquired from only a limited number of clones, if certain
 lineage combinations were rare we might indeed expect to record no examples
 in the limited data set.
 Moreover, if cell fate choice were stochastic, but heavily biased toward
 RPh fate, we might find large entries in a seemingly RPh-specific lineage
 that derived simply by chance and not from early lineage commitment.
 Thus, to calibrate the data we used the stochastic model as a benchmark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Table 2, we also show the expected number of entries for an experiment
 with the same number, 201, of qualifying cell divisions if cell fate outcome
 were random.
 In addition, we have included the number of experiments (each with 201
 qualifying cell divisions) that we would expect to have to perform to find
 at least one experiment with a statistical fluctuation that was equal to,
 or larger than, the actual measured experimental value.
 If this number is greatly in excess of the 75 possible fate outcomes in
 the table, we can consider the entry as an outlier, seemingly inconsistent
 with the random hypothesis.
 If, by contrast, it lies within 75, any departure of the experimental value
 from the expected result can be explained simply as a fluctuation associated
 with small-number statistics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this analysis, we noticed, for example, that the large entry for (RPh,
 RPCRPh) lies well within the expected range for the random model, along
 with the vast majority of other entries, consistent with such combinations
 being produced stochastically.
 However, from the 75 entries, five outliers were identified, which stand
 at three or more standard deviations from the expected average: (RPC, RPCRPC);
 (RPh, AmAm); (RPC, AmBi); (RPC, BiMu); and (Bi, AmBi).
 Such outliers should appear at most only once per 370 entries.
 Moreover, the (Bi, AmBi) entry lies beyond five standard deviations and
 indeed would only be expected to appear around once in 4.6 million experiments.
 Clearly, these cannot be explained simply as a number fluctuation, and
 although the chronology of cell type production might somewhat influence
 lineage selection, these results suggest that, in addition to stochastic
 mechanisms, specific recurring lineages or lineage priming may play a part
 in retinogenesis.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We studied rat retinal progenitors in culture, by reconstructing complete
 lineage trees from time-lapsed imaging.
 We find a great deal of heterogeneity in both size and composition of the
 resulting lineages, but which can be almost entirely explained by a simple
 model of time-invariant progenitors which undergo a stochastic process
 of division and fate specification.
 Whilst there were outliers in the fate outcomes observed, the results suggest
 that a great deal of the development is regulated intrinsically, but not
 stereotypically.
 Nevertheless, we are cautious in interpreting the results, as they are
 in the context of cultured cells at the late end of development.
 In the next chapter, we go on to a 
\emph on
in vivo
\emph default
 system which encompasses a much greater range of the developmental program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
How Stochastic Progenitors Build an Invariant Zebrafish Retina
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the last chapter, we saw that retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) in culture
 can be modelled by a simple stochastic process of independent and time-invarian
t progenitors with fixed proportions for fate outcomes.
 Aside from the occasional correlation in lineage trees which are statistically
 significantly deviant from the model, a more serious problem is that the
 system is 
\emph on
in vitro
\emph default
, with no real tissue being built and so no potential for cell-cell interactions
 to become manifest.
 In this chapter, we move to consider a system in live zebrafish embryos,
 which via a battery of genetic labelling techniques, also allow different
 ways to trace lineage trading detail for data volume .
 However, given the complexity of the system and difficulty of obtaining
 sufficient data, the model will be necessary more descriptive than prescriptive.
 In particular, we have only found a possible model of relative simplicity,
 rather than the unique and most simple model possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter draws significantly from [cite]; the experimental work was
 primary by JH, and ADA, the manuscript by WAH and data analysis by GZ and
 BDS and discussions with MC.
 However, we have elided detailed discussion of the experimental methods
 and their validation (which in itself was a year-long project for the experimen
talists), and focus on the clonal analysis.
 We again refer the interested reader to the published work.

The retina is a pseudo-stratified epithelium, with progenitors being elongated
 with processes that attached each cell to a basal membrane.
 The fully developed retina has distinct layers of cell types (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), but progenitors can, and tend to, move apically before dividing, and
 the daughters will move basally to settle into the correct layer.
 Over a short period of time (20--72 hpf) the retina grows by a factor of
 approximately 12 in cell number, by both expansion in volume and increase
 in density of cells.

From previous works (Hu and Easter, 1999; Neumann and Nuesslein-Volhard,
 2000), it is known that a wave of differentiation progresses from central
 to peripheral and nasal to temporal around the retina.
 Given the asymmetry observed early (24 hpf) in the retina (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-retina-anatomy"

\end_inset

, right), it seems natural to ask if there is actually a wave of proliferation
 that proceeds the differentiation.
 To dissect this behaviour, we used a transgenic fish which labels proliferating
 RPCs with destablized Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to literally visualise
 the proliferation wave (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-fucci"

\end_inset

).
 Counting the exact number of GFP-labelled cells in each half of saggital
 sections, we see that the behaviour of different locations only differ
 by their relative timing, whilst recapitulating (broadly) the same raise
 and fall of labelled cells.
 In particular, note that before the raise (understood to be the proliferation
 wave) the number of labelled cells is constant, implying that the progenitors
 are in a state of quiescence.
 This is consistent with previous results showing that between 15--24 hpf
 RPCs have extremely slow cell cycle times of about 40 hr on average (Li
 et al., 2000).

We thus have a picture of progenitors which are primed for action, waiting
 for a signal.
 Upon receiving that signal, they rapidly divide leading to a rise in number
 of progenitors.
 They then equally rapidly differentiate leading to a decrease in the GPF-label.
 The wave takes approximately 16 hours to progress from the central-most
 nasal side to the outermost temporal side, after which the only remaining
 progenitors reside in the CMZ.

To understand what each progenitor is doing, we turn to clonal analysis.
 The experimental system is another transgenic line involving a cross between
 heat activated fluorescence (MAZe) and photoconvertable fluorescence (Kaede).
 In particular, heat shock (usually performed at 8 hpf) gives rise (with
 selection) to green fluorescent clones of one or two cells at 20 hpf in
 the retina, of which one cell will be chosen at some later time point (usually
 24, 32 or 48 hpf) to be photoconverted to red fluorescence by a UV laser.
 We thus have a choice of both induction time and also imaging time.

 inset) is, on average, approximately inversely correlated with the total
 size of the parent clone at 32 hpf (x axis, shown as the enclosed green
 and magenta cells in inset).
 The points show measurements from individual clones, while the mean and
 SEM are shown in purple.
 If the fate of RPCs is independent of clonally related cells, the average
 size of the subclone after photoconversion is predicted to vary as 
\begin_inset Formula $N/n$

 denotes the average total clone size at 72 hpf and

 Indeed, the measured averages (purple) are broadly consistent with this
 prediction (orange line).

\begin_layout Standard
First, we note that there is a significant lack of odd sized clones from
 progenitors induced at 24 hpf and imaged at 48 hpf.
 This requires divisions in this time window to be predominantly symmetric
 renewal (PP) and sister RPCs should be synchronised --- a feature we had
 already seen in the cultured rat retinal progenitors; there it was not
 a particularly significant feature as PP divisions were rare.
 However, the lack of scarcity of 6-cell clones indicate that divisions
 are not synchronised beyond immediate sisters.
 Second, we see that this is no longer true of clones spanning 24 to 72
 hpf --- indicating asymmetric PD divisions becoming important.
 But if we look at the 48 to 72 hpf clones, we see that almost all divisions
 are terminal (DD), and furthermore with 4-cell clones greatly outnumbering
 3-cell clones, there is almost no PD either.
 Thus we conclude there being at least three separate phases: initially
 highly proliferative, composed of synchronised PP divisions, followed by
 a phase with significant PD divisions, finally almost entirely DD.
 Given such a complex and particular sequence, it is reasonable to ask if
 the progenitors are in fact stochastic at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rule out the possibility that progenitors are pre-programmed at an early
 time (<20 hpf), but rather independently decide their fate, we study a
 slightly subtle aspect of the clone distribution.
 In particular, recall that our induction method actually creates clonally
 related green cells at an early time (and upon selection is this restricted
 to those of one or two cells in the retina at 20 hpf), but the subsequent
 photoconversion only affects one of that clone and turns it red.
 We thus look at the relation between the number of red cells at 72 hpf
 and the number of green cells at 32 hpf (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-clone-dists"

\end_inset

, right).
 We note that the average number of red cells falls as the inverse of the
 number of green cells, indicating that the RPCs index their behaviour by
 a lineage-internal measure rather than a tissue-wide signal.
 Furthermore, there is considerable variance --- if the size of a clone
 is pre-programmed, then there would be almost no variance, as later progenitors
 would know if they belonged to a small or large clone.
 Thus, we see that progenitors are still stochastic, but with evolving probabili
ties for chosing their fate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we will suppose that RPCs form a functionally equivalent, equipotent
 cell population with evolving proliferative potential, which is decoupled
 from the particular specification of individual cell types.
 Through temporal and spatial correlations, we expect to capture many aspects
 of the data, including correlations that might otherwise require a causative
 hypothesis.
 Any residual correlations between lineage and clone size are therefore
 a reflection of the histogenesis of cell types or a signature of early
 fate specification.
 In this paradigm, RPCs follow a (stochastic) developmental program, passing
 from a near-quiescent phase to an active proliferating phase and finally
 to a differentiating phase.
 The initiation and timing of this developmental program is defined by the
 wave of proliferation that sweeps around the retina, starting at the central
 nasal region and terminating at the peripheral temporal zone.
 In the following, we will use the timing of the first mitosis to define
 the start of the development program within each lineage.
 This occurs at around 23 hpf in the central nasal region, reaching the
 peripheral temporal region around 16 hours later.
 For simplicity, we therefore suppose that RPCs enter their active phase
 at a uniform rate, expecting that deviations from this will be beyond the
 resolution of the data.
 If we assume that, over the period from 24 to 48 hpf, RPCs are limited
 to the proliferative phase, measurements of the average clone size over
 this period suggest a cell cycle time of ca.
 6 hr, allowing approximately two rounds of symmetrical cell division.
 (Anticipating the results of the live-imaging study, our simulations are
 actually performed with a shifted gamma distribution, with a refractory
 period of 4 hr, mean of 6 hr, and width of 1 hr.) In addition, the lack
 of odd-sized clones requires a high degree of synchrony between division
 times of sister progenitors; we assume a difference between sister cell
 cycles of around 1 hr, normally distributed.
 Moreover, since the average clone size grows 12- to 13-fold over the period
 from 24 hpf to 72 hpf, we can deduce that each progenitor at 48 hpf must
 go on to produce, on average, three postmitotic cells.
 Thus, we may visualize a ‘‘typical’’ clone to consist of two rounds of
 symmetrical (PP-type) division, one round of asym- metrical (PD-type) division,
 and one round of terminal (DD-type) division leading to the average 12-fold
 increase in average clone size over the time course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the variability in size of clones at 72 hpf, induced at 24 hpf,
 provides a strong signature of stochasticity in cell fate choice.
 We therefore suppose that, within a lineage, the balance between proliferation
 and differentiation is achieved through stochastic fate decisions, with
 probabilities that vary through the developmental stages (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:zf-model"

\end_inset

).
 For simplicity, we assume these changes to occur instantaneously, thus
 avoiding having to parameterize the change beyond just a single time.
 In particular, since clones induced at 48 hpf involve very few three-cell
 clones, PD divisions must be suppressed at these later times.
 Thus, there must be at least two such changes, to start and then stop PD
 divisions; we assume that there are only these two.
 Indeed, the proportion of four-cell to two-cell clones suggests that one
 in five cell divisions involves symmetrical self-renewal, while the remaining
 four divisions are terminal.

Thus, to fully define the model, we only have to specify two time points
 to delineate the intermediate PD phase and the probabilities within that
 phase.
 The times were chosen to be 8 hr and 15 hr after the first mitosis, which
 essentially straddle the subsequent bursts of mitoses; it was found that
 the outcome was not particularly sensitive to the precise timing in any
 case, as long as they did not significantly reassign mitosis to be in different
 phases.
 The proportion of PP divisions was chosen, for simplicity again, to be
 the same as the terminal phase, i.e., one in five.
 The final parameter, the probability for PD divisions, was chosen to give
 the correct average size of 72 hpf clones induced at 24 hpf, which corresponded
 to two in five divisions.
 The proportion of DD is thus two in five during this intermediate phase.This
 model was implemented as a custom-written Monte Carlo simulation, which
 outputs probabilities for observing clones of different sizes.
 While a comparison of the measured clone size distribution to the model
 reveals a favorable fit to the experimental data (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:zf-model-comparison"

), the freedom to adjust control parameters limits its credibility.
 Fortunately, we can make use of the live-imaging data to challenge some
 of the assumptions and predictions of the model, below.

 Amazingly, almost all the features deduced from clonal can be observed,
 such as PP divisions following PD divisions, and the near synchronous sister
 divisions (fig).
 An unexpected feature is a variation of cell cycle length depending on
 fate outcome; in particular, PP and PD divisions are narrowly distributed
 around a similar average of 7.5 ± 1.3 hr, but terminal DD-type divisions
 have cell cycle times of 12.1 ± 1.0 hr.

The reconstructed lineage trees also offer an unprecedented view on how
 histogenesis occurs, i.e.
 how some cell types are born before others.
 At the population level, there is overlap leading to several cells types
 being generated at the same time (fig).
 We seek here to distinguish between simple overlap of strictly defined
 ordering within each lineage, and where ordering is loosely defined within
 individual lineage trees.
 We find that in DD divisions, almost all possible pairs of cell types occur
 (fig).
 This eliminates the possibility of stereotypical succession of cell types,
 however, it does not satisfactorily explain the observed histogenesis.
 To attempt an answer, we performed a qualitative analysis of the available
 data, by trying to compare the clone composition of sister RPCs.
 In particular, we compress each subclone from a tree into a string (represented
 graphically as a bitmap in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:zf-barcode"

, left) and compare strings by a standard Levenshtein distance measure (which
 counts the number of single-character edits that would be necessary to
 turn one string into another).
 Finally, we use a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm to sort the
 strings according to their similarity.
 It was important to compare not only the final cell types generated by
 each lineage but also the structure and order in which the cells appear.
 To do this, we chose a particular representation of trees as strings in
 order to preserve the tree structure.
 Specifically, we embedded each tree into a complete tree of sufficient
 depth, then performed a depth-first traversal to gather the cell types
 into a string (

Discussion

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, based on clonal analysis, we constructed a model for zebrafish
 retinal development, of independent progenitors carrying out a stochastic
 program, with evolving probabilities determined by their space-time location
 in a simple fashion.
 We verified the model with detailed, though limited, lineage trees obtained
 by live imaging studies.
 Although the model explains the fate choice of progenitors and the clone
 sizes observed, it does not satisfactorily explain the cell type choice
 and observed histogenesis.
 The publish work [cite] includes a further experiment dissecting a possible
 link between asymmetric divisions and production of ganglial cells, but
 the conclusions are somewhat preliminary.
